end of the revelation and we shall hardly meet with the like description of misery so emphatical and pathetical set out as this of seafaring man set down both in that second chapter of jonah and in this 107. psalm the misery of job you all know how vehement they be and he never more kind express they then by this translation be I a sea or a whale-fish that thou keep i in ward job 7.12 will you yet see the great danger of sea man I will lead you along to weigh it by a experience and trial of my own in a typhoon or cruel tempest that I meet with off of the island of Macqa^ adjoin to the continent of Chyna in this typhoon or storm our goodly unicorn a ship of 800^ T^nne be cast away upon the continent of Chyna but all the people bless be God save and though at their first land upon the Chyna shore they be rifle by some of the base ^ort of the Chynae^ yet upon the come of the Mandarins or governor they have good entertainment of diet and houseroom for their money and be very kind use by those of better note in this tempest we lose also our pinnace with 24 or 30 man in she which we have send before we to Firando a island adjoin to japan to give notice of our come of who we never hear news we cut off our long boat and let she go we sink our shallop with two man in she who be swallow up by the wave such be this storm as if jonah have be fly unto Tharshish the air be becloud the heaven be obscure and make a egyptian night of five or six day perpetual horror the experience of our seaman be amaze the skill of our mariner be confound our royal james most violent and dangerous leak and those which pump to keep other from drown be half drown themselves with continual pump but God that hear jonah cry out of the belly of hell and who here be say to turn a storm into a calm he pity the distress of his servant he hush the tempest and bring we safe to Firando our wish haven o that the tempest of Macqau may never out of my mind but that this wonderful deliverance and all other god mercy may still be jog i at the elbow and put i in mind to confess before the lord his love kindness and his wonderful work before the son of man that I may exalt he in the congregation of the people and praise he in the assembly of the elder but you will say what need all this discourse touch the danger of seaman we be meet together for another purpose to give thanks unto God belove I do confess indeed it be so that the end of our present meeting be for thanksgiving but how can wee^er be feel thankful as we shall in word and deed if we know not the danger wherein we be and the deliverance vouchsafe unto we will not the true knowledge and deep consideration of these make we put so many the more thanks into our sacrifice of praise wherefore I beseech you to take to heart first the danger of your people in their passage both to Virginia and after their land second the danger of your whole colony there three the danger of yourselves here at home and leave other that be not of your honourable company may think this point impertinent to they let all of we consider the danger wherein we be and still be and the many deliverance vouchsafe unto we for I must entreat you to give i leave to join danger and deliverance together for the better stir of you up unto your duty and then I doubt not but all of we shall have cause to confess before the lord his love kindness and his wonderful work before the son of man and first to touch the danger of your people both in their passage to Virginia and after their land there may I not say in the word of job job 16.3.4 will you give the word of he that be afflict to the wind as if he have say when affliction itself and the inmost sorrow of my heart tell my tale will you not regard it o that your soul be in my soul stead that you feel as much sorrow as I do liquour in queror in I speak that that I speak from a world of trouble I make my complaint in the bitterness of my soul sure if some hundred of those that miscarry in the infancy and at the first beginning of your plantation which be exceed better within these 2. year be now alive I think they will speak no otherwise than job spake^ will you give the word of they that be afflict to the wind will you not believe in what danger we be summer land when some of we make shipwreck upon the suppose enchant land when other of we encounter with bloody enemy in the west indies when many of we die by the way and when those that be leave alive some perish a shore for want of comfortable provision and look unto and other be kill with the bow and arrow of the savage upon our first land there I presume I speak to melt heart of flesh as tender sensible of your brother woe as hearty thankful for your own good and now belove since the case be alter that all difficulty be swallow up and see first there be no danger by the way neither through encounter of enemy or pirate nor meet with rock or shoal all which to seafaring man be very dangerous and from all which your ship and people be far remove by reason of their fair and safe passage through the main ocean nor through the tediousness of the passage the fit season of the year for a speedy passage be now far better know then before and by that mean the passage itself make almost in so many week as former it be wont to be make in month which I conceive to be through the blessing of God the main cause of the safe arrival of your last fleet of nine sail of ship that not one but one in who room there be another bear of eight hundred which be transport out of England and Ireland for your plantation shall miscarry by the way whereas in your former voyage scarce 80. of a 100 arrive safe in Virginia and second see there be no danger after their land either through war or famine or want of convenient lodging and look too through which many miscarry heretofore for bless be God there have be a long time and still be a happy league of peace and amity sound conclude and faithful keep between the english and the native that the fear of kill each other be now vanish away beside there be now in your plantation plenty of good and wholesome provision for the strength and comfort not only of the colony but also of all such as after their passage do land ashore there be also convenient lodging and careful attendance provide for they till they can provide for themselves and a fair inn for receive and harbour of stranger erect in james city to the set up of which both your worshipful governor sir Francis Wyatt and your worthy treasurer master George Sands do write that they doubt not but there will be raise between fifteen hundred and two thousand pound to which every man contribute cheerful and bountiful they be all free-hearted and openhanded to all public good work see I say that now all former difficulty which much hinder the progress of your noble plantation be remove and in a manner overcome and that your people in your colony through God mercy be all in good health every one busy in their vocation as bee in their hive at the set sail of your ship the concord from Virginia in March last o what miracle be these o what cause have you and they to confess before the lord his love kindness and his wonderful work before the son of man but to pass from the danger and deliverance of your people who endanger yea lose their life in settle of your plantation consider I beseech you in the second place the danger wherein your whole colony stand at the time of sir Thomas gate arrive in Virginia from the summer land when it be conclude a few day after his land by himself sir George Summer captain Newport and the whole counsel by the general approbation of all to abandon the colony because of the want of provision and to make for newfoundland and so for England and will not the hopeful settle of your colony there now under the government of a worthy and worshipful commander and a wise and wel-experienced counsel stir you up to confess before the lord his love kindness and his wonderful work before the son of man but if neither the danger of your people nor the danger of your whole colony abroad and the deliverance vouchsafe to they both be enough to stir you up to confess before the lord his love kindness then I beseech you in the three place to consider the danger of your own self here at home what mass of money have you bury in that plantation how many of you have it not make to wish that you have never put your hand to this plough nay how many of you have it not make to shrink in your shoulder and to sink as it be under the burden and to be quite out of hope for ever see penny of that you have so large depurse and now belove be not the case alter be not your hope great of see nay of feel within a few year of double treble yea I may say of tensold for one do not all of you know what that religious and judicious overseer of your college land there write unto you from thence master George Thorpe in his letter write
