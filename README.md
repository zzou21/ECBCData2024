# ECBCData2024

This repository stores the code used by Duke University's 2024 Data+ "Ethical Consumption before Capitalism" research team. The team's goal is to identify how the Virginia Company conveyed the agenda surrounding the education/conversion of Native American communities in and around the 17th century. This project is built on top of the important work done by past years' Data+ and Bass Connections teams.
