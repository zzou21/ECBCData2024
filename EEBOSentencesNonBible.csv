101,"Imprinted at London by the Deputies of CHRISTOPHER BARKER, Printer to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie."
102,"SIR, I thanke you for your Relation of Ferra∣ra; and to make you pai∣ment in the like commo∣dities, I returne to you a true report of a fresh ac∣cident of State, happe∣ned here with vs; memo∣rable for the strangenesse of the matter, and the great signification it cari∣eth with it of Gods ex∣traordinarie and most visible prouidence; but other∣wise woorthy to be damned to perpetuall obliuion, as well for the detestable nature of the fact, as yet more (if more were possible) for the impietie of the perswa∣sion; such as I assure you, a man ought to make scruple to infame the times, or infect mens cogitations with the repetition of it, were it not that these workes of darknesse are framed and forged in such a deepe vawte of hypocrisie, as there is more danger, that they should be vnreuealed or vnbeleeued, then that being brought to cleare light, they should prouoke an imitation in a∣ny, of that which is so odious and foule."
103,"And this Sir you may beleeue, that as I haue had good meanes, to informe my selfe to the full, of that which passed in this matter, and the trueth of all the particulars, aswell those which were opened at the ar∣reignment of Edward Squire, one of the offenders, as those which were reserued, so I haue set downe this Narration, rather abridged of some circumstances, then any wayes amplified or inlarged."
104,"This Squire dwelt in Greenwich diuers yeeres, and tooke vpon him the practise of a Scriuener, yet rather as a helpe to maintaine himselfe for a time, then that he bare a minde to settle in that trade."
105,"He obtained also before his going to Sea, for some two yeres space, an imployment about the Queenes Stable, by way of deputation to one Kaies, a Purueiour of those prouisi∣ons."
106,"But being of a wit aboue his vocation, disliked with that condition of life, and put himselfe into acti∣on by Sea, in the last voyage Sir Francis Drake made into the Indies; in which voyage, it was his hap, that the Frances (a small barke wherein he went) was scat∣tered from the Fleet about Guadalupe, and taken by iue Spanish frigots."
107,"And so was Squire brought pri∣soner into Spaine, where soone after he was set at li∣bertie."
108,"Not long after his inlargement, he became known to Richard Walpoole an English fugitiue, and by order a Iesuite, a man of principall credit there, and a kinde of Vicar generall to Parsons in his absence."
109,"This Wal∣poole, carrying a waking & waiting eye, vpon those of our Nation, to discouer and single out sit instruments for the greatest treasons, obserued this Squire, found him a man of more then ordinarie sence and capaci∣tie, for his qualitie and education; found him a man, that had passed his middle age, well aduised, and yet resolued enough, and not apprehensiue at all of dan∣ger; (for I doe affirme this vnto you, that neuer man answered vpon his triall for life and death, with lesse perturbation, nay scarsely with any alteration, as if he vnderstood not his perill and calamitie, and yet as sensible for speech, as insensible for passion.)"
110,"But be∣sides the disposition and temper of the man, Walpoole discerned in him two conditions of speciall aduan∣tage; The one, that comming into Spaine a prisoner, and not a fugitiue, his returne into England would be subiect to lesse suspition: The other, that he vnder∣stood, Squire had formerly had some attendance a∣bout the Queenes Stable, which he streight caught holde of, as an opportunity."
111,"Yet neuerthelesse, the better to prepare him, and worke him to his purpose; and the better also to giue couler,(when Squire should returne into England) that he was a man that had suffered in Spaine for his con∣science, subtilly he compassed, that vpon a quarrell picked, Squire was put into the Inquisition."
112,"By this meanes, when he had got his heart into his handes, mollified by distresse, and became secure of him, that he was a fixed and resolued Papist."
113,"After probation and preparation sufficient, hee be∣gan to open himselfe vnto him; and first for introdu∣ction, fell into the ordinary burden or song, of that kinde of people, touching the tyrannies and persecu∣tions exercised here in England against Catholiques; though Sir, you know very well, the distinction and moderation of the proceedings here in Ecclesiasti∣call causes, with what lenitie, and gentlenesse, it hath bene caried, except where it was mixed with matter of State; for els I would gladly learne, what should make the difference, betweene the temper of the Lawes in the first yeere of the Queene, and in 23. or 27. but that at the one time, they were Papists in con∣science, and at the other they were growne Papists in faction; or what should make the difference at this day in Lawe, betweene a Queene Mary Priest, and a Seminarie Priest, saue that the one is a Priest of super∣sition, and the other is a Priest of sedition."
114,"But to the purpose; After the Iesuite had at sundry confe∣rences, discoursed his pleasure of the miseries of Ca∣tholiques here in England, and of the slanders of the gouernment, and vpon how fewe persons liues, the State here did stand; and Squire on the other side, (who wanted no witte to perceiue which way hee was ledde) had first made some signification, and after some more serious and vehement protestation of his minde and deuotion, to doe seruice to the cause, when the wicked Frier fawe hee was gotten into the true circle, hee began to charme; and yet not hauing the power to fall vpon the highest point first, without a gradation or bridge, It were no doubt (saith hee) an acte ery meritorious to kill the Earle of Essex, but Vnum necessarium, One thing is necessary."
115,"And hauing kept him in suspence a while, brake with him plainely, and tolde him, that hee would put a seruice into his hands, that he might execute and accomplish, with∣out any euident perill of his life, because it was to be done, what time the Queene her selfe should not bee in presence; (which I thinke he spake as hauing heard that which is very true, of some Conspirators, that hauing vndertaken and vowed her Maiesties destru∣ction, haue neuerthelesse at the very instant of the ac∣cesse and opportunitie, bene stricken with astonish∣ment, and had no power to execute their malice.)"
116,"Nay further he said, that he should not need to feare, in the doing thereof, to be seene or obserued, by any persons of care or iudgement, but such as might be easily conuersed withall, without suspition: And it was the impoysonment of the pommell of the Queenes Sadell, at such time as shee should ride a∣broad; her Maiestie being like to rest her hand there∣upon, for a good time together, and not vnlike for her hand to come often about her face, mouth, and nose∣thrils; and this by reason of his former acquaintance and seruice about the Stable, he thought hee might easily performe, and safely; And yet he said,  Vnto which accursed proposition after that Squire had assented, then did the Frier vse all diligence to confirme and binde him to resolution and perfor∣mance."
117,"And to that ende, at sundry confessions tooke his vow and promise to be constant; caused him to receiue the Sacrament vpon it; renued his diuelish perswasions, varying them in all fourmes to besiege his minde and cogitations, that he might finde no way to get out of this wicked purpose; Telling him  And bid him remember how that sinne did seldome obtaine par∣don; and if he did but once make doubt of the lawfulnesse or merit of the acte, it was enough to cast him headlong downe into hell; And if he did cast any difficulties or terrors, he wished him to consider  So as now Squire must not descend into himselfe, he must make no obiections, cast no doubts; but the eyes of his vnderstanding blinded and sealed vp, he must onely contemplate vpon these vowes and adiurations."
118,"And for a conclusion and finall benediction of this most execrable plot, Squire kneeling before Wallpoole at confession, he lifted him vp, hugde him about the necke with his left arme (such were Squires owne wordes) and crossing him with the other hand after some wordes mumbled in Latine, sayd distinctly to him in English,  And vpon this imbracement and inchantment, this desperate wretch and this blasphemous Exorcist parted for that time."
119,"Then doeth he giue him ful instructions for the dis∣posing of this poison; shewing him that he should re∣ceiue it in a double bladder, and when it should bee vsed, hee was to pricke the bladderfull of holes vpon the vpper part, and so to carie it within the palme of his hand with a thicke gloue for the safegard of his hand: and in the instant when it was to be applied, he should turne it in his hand he vpside downe, and so presse it hard vpon the pommell of the saddell: telling him further of the nature of it, That it would lie and tarrie long where it was laide; and that it would not be chec∣ked by the aire."
120,"And lastly vpon his comming away, deliuered him the confection it selfe in such a bladder as was before described."
121,"This was the true maner of the subornation of Ed∣ward Squire by Richard Wallpoole as it was confessed by the same Squire almost in the same wordes, as well for the perswasions as for the instructions."
122,"Which confes∣sion I doe affirme vnto you vpon knowledge was deli∣uered without torture or shewe of torture: and was roundly and sensibly vttered with all circumstances of a credible narration for that part which concerneth the maner of the impoisonment: and for that part which concerneth the manner of the perswasion was set downe by an aduised declaration vnder his owne hand, and the same as farre as hitherto we haue gone, was mainteined and confirmed, and in no point re∣tracted or disauowed, either at his trial or at his death."
123,"It seemes also that Wallpoole in some of his confe∣rences did insist vpon the impoisonment of the Earle of Essex, the rather to defeate the voyage by Sea, then exspected (for these things past about May 1597.)"
124,"So as Squire conceiued it, there could bee no one thing more acceptable in the second degree."
125,"Nowe after that Squire had receiued both poisons, as well the spirituall poison of wicked resolution, as the materiall within the bladders; and that Wallpoole had interlaced some promise to him of rewardes and comforts, besides those of the other world, and had schooled him for secrecie, which he made to be parcel of his vow, there rested onely his dispatch for England."
126,"Whereunto to giue an apt colour, it was deuised that there should be a permutation treated, by the meanes of a Chanon in Ciuill of two Spanish prisoners here, ta∣ken at Cales, friends of the saide Chanon, for Squire and Rowles nowe Prisoner in the Towre, who came o∣uer with him wherby it might be caried, farre off from suspition, that Squire did not returne as a man imploi∣ed, but vpon that priuate occasion."
127,"According to which proiect he was sent away conueniently money∣ed, that he might be the better in heart, and yet not so abundantly as might make him loue his life too well, and to goe away with his fare quietly, though indeed there were more money stirring, but not in that hand."
128,"And being arriued here in England about a fort∣night before the Earles setting foorth towardes the Ilandes, hee did addresse himselfe to a Counseller of Estate here, both to shew himselfe to the end to auoid suspition, and with pretence also of some aduertise∣ments, to the ende to winne the better opinion and trust; and finding his comming well conceiued of ac∣cording to his desire, hee did craftily and subtilely de∣uise with himselfe, that if he could finde any opportu∣nitie to execute his purpose before the Earle went, (supposing that the poyson could not worke but in some space of time) it would be more securitie for him to be absent, and in the voyage, left percase some suspi∣tious tokens of poison appearing, somewhat might fall out (vpon such diligent inquisition as in such a case were like to bee made) to bee discouered against him; and therefore made his meanes to goe with the Earle in his Shippe and obtained his sute."
129,"So as nowe making his reckoning to haue the peril vpon his back, he did but watch his time."
130,"And it pleased God for the manifestation of his glo∣ry, that the Mundaie seuennight next after Squires comming home out of Spaine, he vnderstood that the horses were making readie for her Maiesties riding a∣broad."
131,"Whereupon, full of those euill spirites where∣with so many exorcismes had possessed him, hee came into the Stable yard where her Maiesties horse stood ready sadled, and in a familiar and cheerefull maner in the hearing of diuers that stood thereby, hauing all things ready according to his instructions, he laied his hand vpon the pommell of the Saddle, and sayd, God saue the Queene, (wherein it pleased God to take his words and not his meaning) and bruized the poison as he was directed."
132,"Thus was her Maiesties sacred and precious life by the All-haile of a second Iudas betrayed, the attempt put in act, and all the Conspirators part plaied to the vttermost line and title; there rested onely Gods part: For so it was, that her Maiesties going abroad held; & as the Viper was vpon S. Pauls hand, and shaked off without hurt; so this done, was in Iuly in the heate of the yeere, when the poores and veines were openest to receiue any maligne vapor or tincture, if her Maiestie by any accident had layd her hand vpon the place."
133,"And as the Heathenish people at that time did argue and conclud thereupon, that S. Paul was a God, so wee may christianly inferre that it was Gods doing and power who hath defended his Handmaid and seruant by his secret and more then naturall influence and pre∣seruatiue from so actuall & mortall a danger, speaking by these signes to all her disloyall Subiects and ambiti∣ous enemies, That as he hath done great things by her, past ordinarie discourse of reason, so he hath done, and will doe as great things for her, beyond the course of his ordinarie prouidence."
134,"For surely, if a man consider how many times her life hath bene sought and assailed, since the beginning of her raigne, by violence, by poisoning, by superstici∣ous Votaries, by ambicious Vndertakers, by singular Conspirators, by Conspirators combined, (speaking of those that haue bene reuealed, besides a number (no doubt) of the like which haue groueled in darkenesse, and neuer came to light) hee will not find the like re∣flexion of Gods fauour in any Soueraigne Prince that hath reigned."
135,"But in the meane time you see the strange mysteries of the Iesuites doctrine that haue mingled heauen and hel, and lift vp the hands of Subiects against the anoin∣ted of God; arming them with the inuisible armour of Scriptures, Sacraments, Vowes, Prayers and Blessings against their naturall Soueraigns."
136,"Wherein there is great difference betweene the spirite that wrought in Dauid, and this that worketh in them."
137,"For Dauid when relation was made to him (by one that thought he had done Saul the last good office) how Saul had fallen vp∣on his owne sword in battell, and being in the anguish of death, and carefull not to fall aliue in the handes of the Philistims a people vncircumcised desired this sol∣diour to make an ende of him, who did so, and was therefore by Dauid adiudged to die, because hee dared to lay his hands vpon the anointed of the Lord: and yet was Saul a king forsaken and abandoned of God; he had taken his mortall wound before, so as this soldi∣our tooke from him his paine, and not his life; and it was to a good ende, least a heathenish people should reproch the name of God by insulting vpon the per∣son of Saul."
138,"And surely for my part I doe wonder that Princes doe not concurre in loosing these bands, and suppres∣sing this Sect, which maketh a traffique of their sacred liues, concluding and contracting for them with these blinded Votaries in the secrecie of confessions and shrifts."
139,"For I doe not see that Pirates (whom the Ciui∣lians account to be Publici hostes societatis humanae, and therefore Princes bound as they affirme, though they be otherwise in no league one with an other, yea and though they be enemies, to ioyne in the suppressing & extirpation of them) are any such disturbers of hu∣mane societie as these are."
140,"Neither doe I thinke, that the order of the Templers (that was put down through∣out Christendome in a fewe weekes) were euer offen∣ders in so high a degree."
141,And I find somewhat strange that the bishop of Rome (if it were but to auoyd the aspersion of so great a slander and imputation to that Religion) should not purge out this leauen so strange and odious.
142,"But to returne: within fiue or sixe dayes after this fact committed, Squire went to Sea in the Erles owne ship, and belike as Tacitus sayth,  taking the remaine of the same poi∣son with him in a little pot in his portmantue, when the Earle was at Sea betweene Faial and S Michael, he bestowed it vpon the pommels of a chaire of wood, where the Earle vsed to dine and sup: but thankes be to God nothing came of it neither."
143,"Now let me acquaint you a little with the maner of detecting of this matter, which God did likewise strangely bring about."
144,"Squire slept now in securitie: for although he failed of successe, yet he tooke him∣selfe to be out of danger: thinking because it was car∣ried betweene his Confessour and him, it could neuer be reuealed."
145,"But his Confessour whom it imported not so much to keepe it secret as it did Squire, tickled belike with the ioy, that he had such an iron in the fire, imparted it (for his owne glory) to some princi∣pall of the fugitiues there; This raised a great expecta∣tion in them of some effect to insue."
146,"When time pas∣sed, and nothing came of it, they made construction of it, that Squire had beene false to them."
147,"One of the more passionate of them inueyeth bitterly against Squire, telles how he was trusted, and how he had vn∣done the cause; and the better to be reuenged on him, is content that one (that they let slip hither as if he had fled from them) should giue information of this mat∣ter, not with the circumstances, but generally against Squire, partly to win himselfe credit, partly to wrecke themselues on Squire."
148,"And this fellow, because hee would be thought to do the better seruice, would not bring this in his mouth, but in a letter, which he pre∣tended to haue stolne out of one of their Studies."
149,"This letter compared with another letter that the same man brought as written from a seuerall person, both which letters had one and the same busie knot to both names, is suspected to be counterfeited; it is so found."
150,"Heereupon it is collected that this was but an engine against Squire, and that he was an honest man."
151,"Yet be∣cause it was a tender matter, Squire was sent for and ex∣amined."
152,"For a time he denieth; after, he commeth to some circumstances, which concurring with the o∣thers tale, it gaue it to be vnderstood that there was somewhat true, and that all was not an inuention a∣gainst him: Holde was taken of that; and thereupon Squire, not knowing how farre his Confessor had bro∣ken trust with him, by good perswasion, and Gods good working, disclosed all without any rigour in the world."
153,"ut vpon a second aduise being a man of a very good reach, finding that it had bene his wisest way to haue confessed the whole plot and subornation which was knowen to Wallpoole, and there to haue stopt, and not to haue tolde of the putting of i in execution, which was onely knowne to himselfe, and which in∣deede was wonne from him by good following, hee endeuoured at his arraignment to haue distinguished, and auowching the first part, to haue retracted the se∣cond; pretending that although he vndertooke it, yet he had not any purpose to performe it."
154,"Whereupon one of the Commissioners being wel acquainted with all the particular circumstances, did set before him the absurditie of his deniall against his former confession which was voluntarie, particular, and needlesse (otherwise then in conscience of trueth) vpon which speech hee being stricken with remorse, and conuicted in himselfe, acknowledged and iustified the trueth of his former confession in the hearing of all the standers by."
155,"Thus Sir, I haue interteined you with a discourse, which I thinke in reading will affect you diuersly, as it did me in writing; But in the ende I thinke wee shall ioyne in congratulating for our good deliuerance, and desiring of God the continuance of her Maiestie, in whom our good dayes do consist."

831,And there this Brute cōquered and dy∣scomfyted the gyauntes abouesayde.
832,¶Explicit prima pars.
833,¶Here begynneth now how Brute was go∣ten / & how he slewe first his moder / & after his fader.
834,And how he conquered Albyon / that af¦ter he named Brytayne after his owne name that now is callyd Englonde after ye name of Engyst of Saxonie.
835,¶This Brute came in to Brytayne aboute the .xviii.
836,BE it knowen that in the noble cytee of grete Troy / there was a noble knyght & a man of grete power that was called Ene¦as.
837,And whan the cyte of Troy was loste & de¦stroyed thrugh them of Grece.
838,Thys Eneas wyth all his meyne fledde thēs & came to Lom¦bardy.
839,That thē was lorde & gouernoure of ye londe a kyng that was called Latyne.
840,And an other kynge there was that was called Turo¦celyne / that strongely warred vpon this kyn∣ge Latyne / that oftentymes dyde hym moche harme And whā this kynge Latyne herde that Eneas was come / he receyued hym with mo∣che honour / & him with helde for as moche as he had herde of hym / & wyst wel that he was a noble knyght & a worthy of hys body & of his dedes.
841,This Eneas helped kyng Latyne ī his warre / And shortely for to telle / so well and so worthely he dyde that he slewe Turocelyne / and discomfyted hym and all his people.
842,And whan all this was done / kynge Latyne gaaf all that londe that was Turocelynes / to thys noble man Eneas in maryage wyth Lauyne his doughter ye moost fayrest creatue that ony man wyst.
843,And so they lyued togyder in yoy & myrthe all the dayes of ther lyftyme ¶And after Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a wyf / & vpon her he gate a sone that was called Sil¦ueyne.
844,And this Silueyne whan he coude so∣me reason of man / vnwetynge his fader and aenst his wyll aqueyted hym with a damoy∣sell that was cosyn to Lauyne that was kynge Latynes doughter ye quene that was Eneas wyf / and brought the damaysell with chylde.
845,And whan Ascanius his fader it wyst / anone lete enqueyre of ye wysest maysters & of ye gret¦test clerkes / what chylde the domoysell sholde brynge forth / & they answerde & sayd / that she sholde brynge forth a sone that shalde kylle bo¦the his fader & also his moder.
846,For his moder deyed in berynge of hym.
847,And whan this childe was borne / his fader lete cal¦le hī Brute And the maysters sayd that he shol¦de do moche harme & sorowe in many dyuers places / and after he sholde come to grete ho∣nour and worshyp.
848,This kyng Ascanius dey∣ed whan god wolde / and Silueyne his sone re¦ceyued the londe / & made hym wonderly well beloued amonge his people.
849,And so whā Bru¦te that was Silueynes sone was .xv.
850,yere ol∣de / he wente vpon a day with his fader for to play & solace.
851,And as Brute sholde haue shot vnto an herte / his arowe myshappe and glā∣ced / and so there Brute slewe hys fader.
852,¶How Brute was dreuen out of the lon∣de / and how he helde hym in Grece.
853,ANd whan this myschaūce was befall all ye people of the londe made sorowe ynough & were sore an angred.
854,And for enche son there of they droue brute out of the lōde / & wolde not suffre hym among them.
855,And whā he sawe that he myght not there abyde / he wē from thens in to Grece / and there he founde .vii.
856,thousande men that were of the lygnage and kynred of Troy that were come of grete blood as the story telleth / as of men and wym¦men and chyldern / the whyche were all hollde in thraldome and bondage of the kynge Pan∣dras of Grece / for the dethe of Achilles that was betrayed and slayne at troy.
857,This brute was a wonder fayre man and a stronge and a huge of his age and of gladde there and sem∣blaunt / and also worthy of body / & was well beloued amonge his people.
858,Thys kyng Pan¦dras herde speke of his goodnes & his condici¦ons / and anone made hym dwelle wyth hym soo that brute became wonder preuy & moche beloued with the kynge / soo that longe tyme brute dwelled with the kynge So at the laste they of Troy and brute spake togyders of kyn¦red and of lygnage & of acquayntaunce / & the¦re playned them vnto Brute of ther sorowe & of ther bondage / & of many other shames that the kynge Pandras had them done.
859,And vnto brute they sayde vpon a tyme.
860,ye be a lorde of our lygnage & a strong man & a myghty ye be our capytayne & lorde / and gouernoure / & we wyll become your men / & your cōmaundemē¦tes doo in all maner of thynges / & brynge vs out of this wretchednesse and bondage / & we wyll fyghte with the kynge for trouthe with ye grace of the grete god / we shal hym ouercome and we shall make you kyng of the londe and to you doo homage / and of you we shall holde euer more.
861,Brute had tho grete pyte of theyr bōdage that they were brought ī.
862,And preuly wente then from the kynges courte and tho them that were of Troy / wente and put them in to woodes and in to moūtaynes and them there helde.
863,And sente vnto kynge Pandras / that he sholde gyue them leue sauely for to wē¦de out of the londe / for they wolde noo lnger dwelle in his bondage.
864,The kynge Pandras wexed tho sore anoyed and tho swore that he sholde slee them euerychone / and ordeyned a grete power and wente to warde them all for to fyght.
865,But Brute and his men māly them defended and fyerfly fought and slewe all the kynges men that none of them escaped / and toke the kynge and helde hym in pryson / and ordeyned counsell bytwen them what they my¦ghte done And some sayde that he sholde be put to dethe / and some sayde that he sholde be exi∣led out of ye londe And some sayd / that he shol∣de be brēte.
866,And tho spake a wyse kynght that was called Mempris / and sayd to Brute and to alle tho of Troy.
867,yf kynge Pandras wolde yelde hym and haue his lyf.
868,I counsell that he gyue vnto Brute that is our duke & our soue¦rayne / his doughter Gennogen to a wyf / and in maryage wyth her an hōdred shyppes well arayed / and all his tresoure of golde & syluer of corne & of wyne / & as moche as we nede to haue of o thyng & other.
869,& then̄e go we out of this londe / & ordeyned vs a londe elles where.
870,For we nenōe of our kynred that come after vs shall neuer haue peas in this londe amōge theym of Grece.
871,For we haue slayne so many of ther knyghtes and of other frēdes that euer more warre and contake sholde be among vs Brute tho and all his folke consented well to that counseyll.
872,And this thynge they tolde to kyng Pādras.
873,And he for to haue his lyf graū¦ted as moche as they axed / and anone gaf vn∣to Brute Gennogen his doughter to wyfe / & an hondred shyppes with asmoche / as them neded of all vytaylles / as afore was ordeyned Brute tho toke his wyfe and all his men / that forsoke the londe of Grece and went them vn¦to the see and had wynde & weder at theyr wyll and came ye thyrde daye in to an Ile that was called Lorgers.
874,Thys Brute anone sente of his men a londe for to espye the maner of the countree.
875,And they founde an olde cyte all wa¦sted and forlet that was ther in nother mā ne woman / ne no thynge dwellynge / and in the mydeell of this cyte they founde an olde tem∣ple of a fayre lady that was called Dyana the goddesse.
876,And they came ayen vnto Brute & tolde hym what they had seen and foūde.
877,And they counselled hym to goo and doo sacrefyce vnto dame Dyana / for she was wōte to yeue answere of what euer men prayed her and na∣mely vnto them that her honoured with sacre¦fyce.
878,Brute wente vnto that yamge and sayd Dyana noble goddesse that all thynge haste in thy myght and power / wyndes / waters.
879,woo∣des / felde / and all thynge of the world / and all manere of beestes that theryn ben.
880,To you I make my prayer / that ye me counseyll and tel∣le / where / and in what place: I shall haue a co¦uenable dwellynge for me and for my people and there I shal make in honour of you a well fayre temple and a noble / wherin ye shall al¦waye be honoured / whā he had done his pray¦er.
881,Dyana answerd in this maner Brute say∣de she go euen forth thy waye ouer the see in io Frauce to warde the west / and there ye shall fynde an yle that is called Albyon / & that yle is be compassed all wyth the see / and noo man maye come ther in but it be by shyppes and in that londe were wonte to dwelle gyauntes / but now it is not soo / but all wyldernes.
882,And that londe is destenyed and ordeyned for you and for your people.
883,¶How Corin became Brutes man / and how kynge Goffar was dyscomfyted.
884,THenne whan Brute had this answere of Dyana the goddes.
885,Anone he lete ye ancres wynde vp & sayled in to the hyghe see.
886,And whan he & his men had saylled .xx.
887,dayes and moo / they foūde fast besyed a cost of ye see a thousande men of the lygnage & kynred of Troy.
888,And ther souerayne & ther mayster of all was called Corin· And whan Brute wyste whens they were / he tho toke them wyth mo∣che Ioye in to hys shyppes / and ladde theym forth wiht hym Th{is} Corin there be came bru¦tes man & to hym dyde homage.
889,And so longe they saylled forth in the see tyll they cam vnto Gascoyne.
890,And anone they arryued in the ha¦uen of Lyegers & there they dwlled .viii.
891,day∣es them for to rest.
892,& ther saylles to amēde the¦re that it was nede.
893,Tydynges soone came to kynge Goffar that was lorde of that lōde howe that moche people of straūge londe were arry¦ued in to his lōde in ye hauen of Lyegres wher¦fore he was sore angreged & anoyed / that they came and arryued in his londe wythout his ly¦cence and his leue.
894,And anone ordened hym a gret power for to dryue out brute & to destroye hym & all his people.
895,But it was so that kyng Goffar was dyscomfyted & all his peple.
896,And hym self fledde in to Fraūce / there for helpe & socour.
897,And in that tyme regned in Fraunce ·xii.
898,kynges / & an .xi.
899,of them assembled a grete power for to helpe Goffar & for to fight ayest Brute.
900,This Goffar dwelled with thē of fraū¦ce halfe a yere & more.
901,And in the meane tyme whan Goffar was in Fraūce.
902,Brute and his company destroyed all the londe of Gascoyne and lete take all the tresour that kyng Goffar had / & there lete brynge it all in to his shyppes And this Brute founde in that londe a fayry place and couenable / & there brute made a fay¦re castel and a stronge.
903,¶whan that this was done / kyng Goffar came from Fraunce and .xi.
904,kynges with hym and brought wyth hym .xx.M.
905,men for to fyghte with Brute and his company and Brute had but .vii.M.
906,And neuertheles whanne the two hostes mette togyder.
907,Brute folke thorugh helpe of hymself: & of Turin his cosen: and of Corin ye well and manly hym defended: and fought so tyll that in lytell tyme they hadde slayne of the Frensshemen two thousande & mo.
908,Anone all that were alyue fledde awaye.
909,And in this ba∣taylle Turin Brutes cosyn was slayne.
910,And Brute lete entere hym worthely whan he had space & leyser in the castell that he had made: & tho lete calle that same castell Toures: For by cause of the name of Turin that there was en¦tred.
911,And yet vnto this day there is a noble cy¦te that is called Toures.
912,And kynge Goffar wyste that Turin was deed he came agayne with his men: & after yaue a stronge bataylle vnto Brute.
913,But brute & his men were so we¦ry for fyghtynge: that they myght noo lenger endure: but to megre hym & all his.
914,And then Brute yede in to his castell with his men: and made the gates faste for to saue them: and for to take counsell amoage them what were best for to do.
915,Brute and Corin gaaf counsell and ordeyned pryuely: that Corin sholde go oute & busshe him ī a wood tyll on the morne soo that in the mornynge whan that Brute sholde fy∣ghte with his enemyes: thenne Corin shold co¦me with his folke in the one syde: and slee and do all the harme that he myght.
916,And in a mor∣nynge in the dawnynge of the daye Brute wē¦te out of the castell: and fyersely faughte with his enmyes: and they manly deffended them.
917,But within a lytell tyme Brute and his folke slewe .viii.
918,hondred of kynge Goffars men.
919,Thenne came Corin with ye busshement and smote to grounde he & his companye all those that wolde stonde or abyde.
920,So that the kyng Goffar & his cōpany were dyscōfyted: & faste they began to flee And brute & Corin with ther cōpany fyersely them pursewed & slewe mo of them in ye fleynge than they dyd in ye batayll.
921,And ī this maner Brute had the victory.
922,and neuertheles brute made moche sorowe for his cosyn Turī that there was slayne & other also that he haded lost of his men.
923,That is to saye.
924,vii· hondred and .xv.
925,The whiche nobly he en¦tered in the same castell of Toures / there whe¦re he had entered Turin his cosyn.
926,¶How Brute arryued at Totnesse in the yle thenne called Albyon / and of the bataylle that was betwixt Corin and Gogmagog.
927,SO whan all this was done Brute wol¦de no lenger there dwell / for to fyghte / nor for to lese no moo of his people.
928,For kynge Goffars people myghte euery daye encreace / mo and moo.
929,And Brutes lossened.
930,And ther∣fore he toke all his men and wente vnto the see and had wende and weder at theyr wyll.
931,And the fyfth daye after they arryued in an hauen at Totnesse / and came in to the yle of Albyon And there neyther man nor woman as the sto¦ry telleth they founde but Gyaūtes.
932,And they dwelled in hylles & in caues.
933,And Brute sawe the londe was fayre and at his lykynge.
934,And was good also for hym and for his people / as Dyan a the goddesse hadde hym behyght.
935,And therfore was Brute wonder gladde and lette assembled vpon a daye all his ole to make a solempne sacrefyce and a grete feest in honour & reuerence of Dyana the goddesse of the whi¦che he hadde counseyll fyrste for to come in to this londe.
936,And thenne whan that they hadde ther solempnyte done / as they vpon a daye sa∣te at ther meete / there came in vpon them .xxx gyauntes & slewe of Brutes men .xxx.
937,Brute and his men anone strete vp and faught with the gyauntes and slewe them euerychone exce¦pte one that was called Gogmagog.
938,& he was mayster of all the Gyauntes.
939,And he was strō¦ger and hygher than ony of other.
940,And Brute kepte hym for by cause that he sholde wrestyll with Corin that was Brutes mā.
941,Fo he was greter & hygher than ony of bruces men from the gyrdelstede vp warde.
942,¶Gogmagog and Corin vndertoke there for to wrestell.
943,And so togyders they wente / and wrestlyd a longe ty∣me / but at the last Gogmagog Helde Corin so fast that he brake two rybbes of h syde wher∣fore Corin was sore angry.
944,And there he toke Gogmagog betwixt his armes and cast hym downe vpon aroche / soo that Gogmagog bra¦ke all to peces / and soo he deyed an euell deth.
945,And therfore the place is called vnto this day∣the saute of Gogmagog.
946,¶And thenne after Brute yaue alle that contree vnto Corin.
947,And there Corin called it after his name Cor∣newayl.
948,And his men he called Cornewayl∣les / and so sholde men of tha countree be cal∣led for euermore / And in that contree dwelled Corin and hys men.
949,And they made townes and howses / and enhabyted the londe by theyr owne wyll ¶How Brute buylded London and cal∣led thys londe Brytayne / and Scotlonde Albyne / and walys Camber.
950,depiction of London BRute and his men wente forth / and sa∣we about in dyuers places / where that they myght fynde a good place and couenable that they myght make a Cyte for hym and his folke.

953,And thenne he departed the londe to theym / so that euery∣he of theym had a parte / and a certayne place for to dwelle in.
954,¶And thenne Brute lette calle this londe Brytayne after his owne na∣me and his folke he lette calle Brytons.
955,And this Brute had goten on his wyf Gennogen thre sones / that were worthy of dedes.
956,The fyrst was called Lotrin / the seconde Albanak and the thyrde Cambar.

967,The whiche began to regne the seconde yere of Samuell.
968,And this Lotrin was crowned kynge wyth moche solempnyte and glorye of all the londe of Brytayne.
969,And after whan he was crowned kynge.
970,Albanak and Cambar his two brethern wente agayne into theyr ow¦ne countree & there they lyued with moche ho∣nour / & worshyp.
971,And Lotrī theyr brother reg¦ned / & was kynge & gouerned it well & wysely for he was a good man & wonderly well belo∣ued of all his londe.

6535,¶And Syr Roger Clyfforde a noble & a worthy knyghte stode euer & fought / and well & worthyly hym defended as a noble baron.
6536,But at the last he was sore woundyd in his heed / And syr Wylly¦am of Sullaynde.

6547,And the londe was tho without lawe For holy chyrche had tho nomore creuereence than it had be a burdell hous / And in that ba∣tyall was the fader ayenst the sone and the vn¦cle ayenst the neuewe.
6548,For so moche vnkynde¦nesse / was neuer seen before in Englonde / as that tyme amonge folkes of one nacyon.
6549,For one kynred had noo more pyte of that other.
6550,than an hungry wulf hathe of a shepe / And it was no wonder.
6551,For the grete lordes of Eng∣londe were not alle of one nacyon / But were medlyd with other nacōns / That is for to say some / Brytons / some Saxons / some Danys / some Pehypes / some Frenssemen / some Nor∣mans / some Spanyerdes / some Romayns / some Henaude some Flemynges and other dy¦uers nacyons the whyche nacyons accordyd not to the kynde blood of Englonde.

6626,Tho made the kynge Robert Baldok a fale pylled clerke Chaunceler of Englond.
6627,thrugh counsell of the forsayde Spensers.
6628,¶And he was a false rybaude / And a coueytouse.

6898,and many tow¦nes sholde be made playne.
6899,And he sayd sothe / For whan that kynge Edwarde was dyscō¦fyted in Scotlonde & came tho south warde / ye Scottes besegyd the castels / & dyde them mo∣che harme & brent townes in to the herde erth ¶And after ward Merlyn tolde that an Egle sholde come of Corne wayle / that sholde haue feders of golde / yt of pryde shold haue no pere & he shelde dyspyse lordes of blod & after he shol¦de dey throgh a beer at Gauersych & that pro∣phecye was full well knowe & funde sothe For by the egle vnderstonde syr Pers of ganaston that tho was erle of Corne wayle yt was a won¦der proude man that dyspysed ye baronage of Englonde.

6912,And that they sholde counsell the gote to meue warre ayenst the for¦sayd beer.
6913,And the gote and the owles.
6914,sholde to an arme of the see at Burton trente / & shol∣de go ouer / & that for drede the beer sholde flee with a swanne in companye to Bury towar∣de the.

6916,that sholde stonde vppon poun∣fret / vpon whom the sonne shall shede his bee∣mes.
6917,And many folke hym shalle seke for ver∣tue.
6918,And he sayd sothe.
6919,For the good erle Tho¦mas of Lancastre was borne in ye Northwest And cosyn to the kynge.
6920,& his vncles sone.
6921,and by lawe he made the kynge lese moche londe / the whiche he had purchacyd wylfully.
6922,tyll at the last the kyng toke therof shame / & hym self slewe with cruelte And after he gate ayen that he had lost / and moche more thrugh folke that he ette assēble out of ye Northwest / tha made hym to be adradde.
6923,And auengyd hym on his barons / thrugh counsell of syr Hugh Spenser the fader / and of syr Hugh the sone that before were outlawed for theyr wyckydnesse· But af¦terwarde they came ayen in to Englonde / syr e wer vpon Thomas of Lancast.
6924,Soo yt the kynge and the Spensers & the erle of Arun¦dell and theyr power mette wyth Thomas of Lancastre Burton vpon trente / and hym there dyscomfyted and syr Vmfroy erle of her forde was in his company.
6925,And after fledde ye forsayd Thomas and Humfroy with theyr cō∣pany to burbrugge metinge with syr Andrew of Herkela / that is callyd the vnkynde outpul∣ter / and also syr▪ Symonde warde erle of yor∣ke came and mette with Thomas of Lancas¦tre with an huge power / and thē dyscomfyted & in that scomfyture the erle of Herforde was slayne vpō the brydge cowardly wyth spere in the foundement.
6926,and the erle Thomas was ta¦ke & ladde vnto Poūfret.
6927,and tho was heedyd besyde his owne castell.
6928,But afterwarde ma∣ny hym sought for myracles that god dyde for hym.
6929,¶And in that tyme Merlyn sayd.
6930,for so¦rowe and harme shold deye a people of his lon¦de / wherfore many londes shold be vpon hym the more bolder / and he sayd sothe for bycause of his barons that were doone to dethe for saȳt Thomas quarell of Lancastre.
6931,peple of many londes became the bolder / for to meue werre v¦pō the kyng / for theyr blood was torned to ma¦ny nacyons.
6932,And afterwarde Merlyn tolde & sayd that the forsayd owles sholde doo moche harme vnto the flour of lyf and deth / and they shold brynge her to moche / dysese.
6933,So that she sholde go ouer see into Fraunce.
6934,for to make pe¦as to the floure delyte.

6936,And put thē to pyteuous deth.
6937,And that prophecy was full well knowe.
6938,and was full sothe / for syr Hugh Spenser the fader.
6939,and syr Hugh the sone / dyde moche soro¦we & persecucyon vnto ye quene Isabel thrugh theyr procurement to her lorde the kynge / So they ordeyned amonge them.
6940,that she was wa¦gys.
6941,That is to saye .xx.
6942,shelynges in the daye wherfore ye kynge of Fraūce her brother was sore anoyed.
6943,and sente into Englonde by his let¦ters vnto kynge Edwarde to come vnto hys parlement to Parys in Fraunce.
6944,But kynge Edwarde was sore adradde to come there / for he wende to haue be arestyd tyll yt he had made amendes for the trespase ye syr Hugh Spenser the fader and the sone had done and for ye har∣me that they had done vnto quene Isabell h syster / wherfore thrughe hys ordynaunce and consente of the.

6946,And ther dwellyd she in Fraunce tyll Edwarde her Eldest sone came her for to seke / and so they dwellyd there both tyll that alyaunce was made bytwene thē and the gentyll erle of Henaude / that yf they wyth ther vertue myght dystroye and ouercome the venym and the falsnesse of the Spenser / that syr Edwarde sholde spowse dome Phylyp the worshypfull lady / & the erles doughter of He∣naude / wherfore the quene Isabel and Edwar¦de her sone / and syr Edwarde of wodstok the kynges brother of Englonde / and syr Iohn̄ of Henaude / and syr Roger Mortymer of wyg∣more / and syr Thomas Rocelyn and syr Io∣han of Cromwell and syr wyllyam Trussell / and many other of the alyaunce of the gentyll erle Thomas of Lancastre / that were exyled out of Englonde for his quarel / and were dys¦heryted of theyr londes / ordeyned / them a gre∣te power / and arryued at Here with in South folke / And soone after they pursewed ye Spen¦ses tyll that they were takē & put pyteuous de∣the as before is sayd.
6947,and theyr cōpany also for the grete falsnes yt they dyde to kynge Edwar¦de to his peple.
6948,¶And Merlyn sayd also more that the gote sholde be put in grete distresse and in grete angusshe and in grte sorow he sholde be lede his lyf / and he sayd sothe For after the time that kyng Edwarde was take he was put into warde tyll that the Spensers were put to deth / and also bycause that he wolde not come vnto his parlement at.

7011,But syr Roger Mortymer cōsentyd not therto / for he had pry¦uely taken mede of the Scottes them to helpe that they myght go away into theyr owne coū¦tre.
7012,¶And this same Mortymer counseylled somoche Thomas of brotherton ye erle Mar¦shall that was kynge Edwardes vncle.
7013,that ye forsayd Thomas shold not assemble at ye tyme vnto the Scottes.
7014,And he assentyd.

7020,And in the meane why∣le the Scottes stele by nyght to ward theyr ow¦ne coūtre as fast as they myght.
7021,¶And so was the kyng fasly betrayed that wenyd that alle ye traytours of londe had ben brought to an ende as it was sayd before.
7022,¶Now here you lor∣des how tratoursly kyng Edwarde was dys∣ceyued.
7023,& how meruayllously.
7024,& boldly the scot∣tes dyde of werre / For Iames douglas wyth two hūdred men of armys rode thrught out all the host of kyng Edwarde / the same nyght the Scottes escaped towarde theyr owne coūtree as is aboue sayd / tyl that they came to ye kyng{is} pauylyon / & slew there many men in theyr bed¦des / & cryed Naward naward / and nother ty∣me a Douglas a Douglas wherfore the kyng that was in hys pauylyon & moche other lke were wonder sore a frayed / But blyssyd be al∣myghty god ye kynge was not taken / & in gre∣to peryll was tho the reame of Englonde.

7093,in the yere of grace.
7094,to greate harme & em∣payrynge of all the kynges blode wherof that gentyll lady came.
7095,alas the tyme / For wonder moche ye fayer dāoysell dysperagyd / syth that she was maryed ayenst al the comyns wyl and assent of Englonde.
7096,And frome the tyme that Brute had conquered Albyon· & named the lon¦de after his owne name.
7097,Brytayne: that now is callyd Englonde after the name of Engyst And so the reame of Scotlonde was holde of the reame of Englond / & of ye crowne by feau¦te & homgae.
7098,For Brute conquered that londe & yaue it to Albanak / yt was his seconde sone / And he callyd ye londe Albayn after hys owne name / soo that hys heyres yt came after hym.
7099,shold holde of Brute & of his heyres / yt is to say of the kynges of Brytayn / by feaute & homa∣ge: And frome that tyme vnto thys tyme of kynge Edwarde / the tame of Scotlond was holde of the reame of Englonde by feaute and seruyce / as aboue ys sayd in the Cronycles of Englonde & of Scotlonde & berythe wytnesse more playnely.
7100,And accursyd be ye tyme that this parlement was holden at Northampton For there by fals councyll.
7101,the kyng was there falsly dysheryted and yet he was with in aege.
7102,¶And yet whan that kyng Edward was put out of hys ryalte of Englonde yet men put not out of the feautes & seruyse Scotlonde.
7103,Ne of the fraunchyses dysheryted hym for euer mo∣re.
7104,¶And neuertheles the grete lordes of eng∣londe were ayenst to conferme the peas & the rwes abouesayd / saf only quene Isabell / yt tho was the kynges moder Edwarde / and the bysshop of Ely / and the lorde Mortimer.
7105,But reason and lawe wolde not that a fynalle peas sholde be made bytwene them without the co∣myn assente of Englonde.
7106,¶Of the debate that was bytwene quene Isabell & syr Henry erle of Lancastre & of Ley¦cetre / and of the rydynge of Bedforde.
7107,THen as the for sayde Dauyd had spow∣syd dame Iohan̄e of the toure in ye tow¦ne of Berwyk as before is sayde / The Scot∣tes in dyspyte of ye Englysshmen called dame Iohanne the countesse make peas / for the co∣wardly peas yt tho was ordeyned.
7108,But ye kyn∣ges persone bare all the wyte and blame wyth wronge of makynge of the accorde / And alle was done thrugh the quene / & Roger Morty∣mer.
7109,And it was not longe after that the quene Isabell ne toke in to her hond{is} all the lordshyp of Pountfret almoste all the londes that were of ony value that apperteyned to the crowne of Englonde / Soo the kynge had not to dys∣pendede / but of hys vses and of hys escheker / For the quene Isabell & the Mortymer hadde grete mayne of the retenewe yt folowed ye kyn∣ges courte euer more & went and toke the kyn∣ges pryces for her peny worthes at good ch∣pe / wherfore the countre that they came in we¦re / fullsore addrade / and almoost dystroyed of theym.
7110,¶Tho began the comynate of Eng∣londe for to haue enuye to Isabell the quene.
7111,yt somoche louyd her before whan she came ayen for to pursue ye fals traytours ye Spensers fro Fraunce.
7112,And in that same tyme the fals tray¦tour Roberte of Holonde / that bytrayed hys lorde syr Thomas of Lancastre.
7113,was tho de∣lyuerde and out of pryson / & was wonder pre∣uy witth the quene Isabell / & also with Roger Mortymer.
7114,But that auaylld hym but lytyll For he was taken at Myghelmasse yt tho cam nexte after / as he rode to warde quene Isabell to London / and syr Thomas whyther smote of his heed besydes the towne of saynt Albons And thys syr Thomas dwelled with syr Hen∣ry erle of Lancastre / and he put hym asyde for drede of the quene / For the quene loued hym wonder moche.
7115,And prayed vnto the kyng for hym that ye same Thomas might be exyled out of Englonde.
7116,And the noble erle syr Henry of Lancastre had often tymes herde the comyn claymore of ye Enghysshmen / of ye dysease that were doon in Englond / & also for dyuers wrō∣ges that were done to the comyn people.
7117,of the whyche the kyng bare the blame with wronge For he was but fulle yonge & tender of aege.
7118,& thought as a good man / for to do awaye / & sla∣ke the sklaūder of ye kynges persone / yf that he myght in ony manere a wyse / so as the kynge was therof nothynge gylty / wherfore he was inperyll of lyf & lymme· ¶And so he assēbled all his retenuwe & wente & spake with them of the kynges honoure / and also for to amende his estate.
7119,And syr Thomas Brotherton erle of Marchall / and syr Edmond wodstok / that were the kynges vncles / and also men of Lon∣don made theyr othe hym fo.
7120,to mayntene in ye same quarell.
7121,And theyr cause was this / that the kynge sholde holde his house and hys mey∣ne / as a kyng ought for to do / and haue all his ryalte· And that the quene Isabell sholde de¦lyuer out of her hondes in to the kynges honde alle manere of lordshyps rentys / townes and castels that apperteyneth vnto the crowne of Englonde as other quenes haue done here be∣fore / and medle with none other thynge.
7122,¶And also that syr Roger Mortymer sholde abyde and dwelle vpon his own londes / For moche people / In so moche that the comyn people were dystroyed and gretely domaged / thoroughe suche wrongfulle takynge.
7123,¶And also the enquere howe and by whome that the kynge was betrayed and falsly dysceyued att Stanhope / and thrughe whose counseyll that the Scottes went awaye by nyght from the kynge / And also how and thrugh whoos coun∣seyll the ordynaūce that were made at the kyn∣ges coronacyon / was put downe.
7124,That is to saye / that the kynge for amendement and hel∣pynge of his reame / & in honour of hym sholde be gouerned and rulyd by .xii.
7125,of the grettest & wysest lordes of the reame / and wythout them Sholde no thynge be grauntyd ne done / as be¦fore is sayd / whiche couenauntes were malicy¦ously put downe fro the kynge / where many harmes.
7126,shamys and repreues haue falle to the kyng & hys reame / and that is to vnderstonde for asmoche as Edwarde kynge of Englonde some tyme / was ordeyned by assent in playne parlement for to be vnder warde & gouernaun¦ce of Henry erle of Lancastre his cosyn / for sal¦uacyon of hys dody he was take out of the cas∣tell of Kenilworth / there that he was in warde.
7127,& thrugh colour of quene Isabell / & of the Mor¦tymer without consent of ony parlement they tooke & ladde hym there that neuer after none of his kynred / myght wyth hym speke ne see.
7128,& after tratorursly toke & morored hym for who∣se deth arose a sklaūdre thrugh all crystendom whan it was done.
7129,And also the tresore ye syre Edwarde of Kernaruian left in many places in Englonde and in walys was wastyd & bor∣ne awaye / wythout the wyll of kynge Edwar¦de his sone / in dystruccyō of hym & of al his fol¦ke.
7130,¶Also thrughe whose counseyll / that ye kyn¦ge yaue vp the kyngdom of Scotlond / for the whiche reame / the kynges aūcetours had full sore traueiled / and so dyd many a noble mā for theyr ryght / & was delyuered vnto dauyd that was Robert brus sone all ye ryght / yt no ryght had to the reame.
7131,as all the world it wyst.
7132,And also by whom the chartres & remēbraunces yt they had of the ryght Scotlond were take out of the tresory / taken to the Scottes the kynges enmyes / to dysheritynge of hym and of his suc¦cessours / & to grete harme of hys lyeges / & gre¦te repreef to all Englysshemen for euer more.
7133,¶Also wherfore dame Iohan of the toure the kynges syster Edward / was dysperagyd and maryed vnto Dauyd that was Robertbrus so¦ne.
7134,that was a traytour & enmye vnto Englon¦de.
7135,& thrugh whoos counseyl she was take into our enmyes hondes out of Englonde.
7136,¶And in this meane whyle.
7137,ye good erle Henry of Lā¦castre & hys companie toke counseyl how those poyntes aboue sayd myght be amended to the worshyp of the kynge & to hys profyte & to the profyte of his leyg{is} / and the quene Isabel thru¦ghe coniectynge & also of the Mortymers lete ordeyne a parlement at Salysburye.
7138,And at ye same parlement / the Mortymer was made er¦le of Marche ayenst all the barons wyll of En¦glonde in preiudyce of ye kyng & of hys crowne And syr Iohan of Eltham the kynges brother was gyrde with a swerde of Corne waylle.
7139,and tho was callyd erle of Corne waylle.
7140,& euer mo¦re quene Isabell procuryd so moche ayenst her sone ye kyng / that she had the warde of ye forsay¦de syr Edward & of his lōdes.
7141,And at that par∣lemente the erle of Lancastre wolde not come / But ordeyned all his power ayenst quene Isa¦bel and the Mortymer / And men of London or¦deyned them with fyue hūdred men of armys.
7142,¶Whan quene Isabel wist of the doynge swore by god and by hys names full angerly / that in an euell tyme he thought vppon tho po∣yntes / Tho sente the quene Isabell & the Mor¦tymer after theyr retenwe & after the kyngys retenewe / soo that they had ordeyned amonge them an huge hoste.
7143,And they counseylled the kynge / so that vppon a nyght they rode .xxiii.
7144,myles to Bedford / there the erle of Lancastre was with his company / and thought to haue hym dystroyed / and that nyght she rode besyde the kynge her sone as a knyght for drede of de∣the.
7145,And it was done the kyng to vnderstond / that the erle Henry of Lancastre and hys com¦pany wolde haue dystroyed the kyng and hys counseylle for euer more / wherfore the kynge was somdele to wardes hym heuy and anoye ¶Whan the erle Marshall and therle of Ken∣te the kynges brother herde of thys tydynges / they rode soo in message bytwene theym / that the kynge grauntyd hym hys peas to therle Henry of Lancastre / for a certayne raunsom∣me of an leuen thousande pounde / But that was neuer payed afterwarde.
7146,And thyse were the lordes that helde with Syr Henry of Lan¦castre.
7147,Syr Beaumont / syr Fouk fytz waren syr Thomas Rocelyn / Syr wyllyam Trus∣dr ynghtes moo that were to hym consen¦ted / and alle those were exyled thrughe coun∣seylle of the quene Isabell and of Mortymer.
7148,For ye Mortymer wayted to haue theyr lōdes yf that he myght thrugh ony maner coniectyn¦ge / For he was to coueytous & hadde to moche his wyll and that was grete pyte.
7149,¶How kynge Edwarde went ouer the see for to doo his homage vnto the kynge of Fraū¦ce / for the duchye of Guyhenne.
7150,IT was not longe after that the kyng of Fraunce / thrugh counseyll of hys Don∣zepers / sente to kynge Edwarde of Englode that he sholde come to Parys & do his homage as reason it wolde / for the duchye of Guyon / & so thrughe coūsell of the lordes of Englonde kynge Edwarde went ouer see.
7151,And at the As∣cyon tyde / he came vnto Parys / the thyrde ye¦re of his regne / for to do his homage vnto the kyng of fraūce.
7152,& the kyng receyued hys homa¦ge / & made of hym moche Ioy & worshyp / but whan kynge Edwarde had done hys homage hastyly he was sent for in to Englonde thrugh the quen Isabell his moder & anone hastyly he came ayen in to Englonde / vpon wytsonday without ony takynge leue of ye kynge of Fraū¦ce.
7153,wherfore he was wonder wrothe.
7154,¶How syr Roger Mortymer bare hym proudely and soo hyghe.
7155,ANd now shall ye here of syr roger mor¦tymer of wygmore that desyred and co¦ueted to be at an hygh astate / so that the kyng grauntyd hym to be callyd erle of Marche tho¦rughe out all hys lordshyp.
7156,And he became soo proude & hauteyn / yt he wolde lese & forsake the name yt his elders had euer be fore / & for ye cau∣se he let hym calle erle of marche.
7157,And none of the comnyns of Englonde durste calle hym by other name / for he was callyd so by ye kyngys crye.
7158,that men shold calle hym erle of Marche And mortymer bare hym so hauteyn & so prou¦de that wonder it was for to wyte.
7159,& also dys∣guysed hym with wōnder ryche clothes out of al manere of reason / both of shapynge and of werynge.

7161,& they syd amonge them comynly / yt his pryde shol∣de not longe endure.
7162,¶And the same tyme syr Gyffray Mortymer the yonge / that was mor¦tymers sone.
7163,lete calle hym kynge of foly / and so it befell after warde in dede / for he was soo full of pryde and of wretchydnesse / that he hel¦de a rounde table in walys / to all men that the der came / and coūterfeted the doynge and the manere of kyng Arthurs table / but openly he fayled / for the noble kynge Arthur was ye mo¦ost noble lord of renomme / that was in all the worlde in hys tyme & yet came neuer none su∣che after / For all ye noble knyghtes ī all crystē¦dom of dedys of armys assayed / dwellyd wyth kynge Arthur / & helde hym for there lorde and souerayne / And that was well seen / for he con¦quered in a bataylle a Romayne yt was callyd Froll.

7165,¶How Edmonde of wodstok that was er¦le of Kente & the kynges brother Edwarde of Carnaryuan / was heedyd at wynchestre.
7166,ANd vppon a tyme it befell soo / that syr Edmonde of wodstok erle of Kent spa∣ke vnto pope Iohan the .xxii.

7175,that he sholde helpe with all the power that he myght / that he were deliuered out of pryson / & saue his body in all manere that he myght.
7176,And to bryn¦ge this thynge to an ende he assoyled hym & his cōpany a pena et culpa) & all that to his delyue¦raūce.
7177,Tho toke Edmond of wodstok his leue of ye pope & came ayen into Englōde / & whā syr Edmonde was come / some of ye frere prechers came & sayd that syr Edwarde his brother yet was alyue in ye castell of Corf / vnder ye kepyn∣ge of syr Thomas Gurnay.
7178,tho sped hȳ the for¦sayd Edmonde as fast as he myght / tyll he ca∣me to ye castel of Corf / & acquaynted hym & spa¦ke so fayre to Iohn̄ Dauerel / that was conesta¦ble of the same castell / & yaue hym ryche yeftes for to haue acquayntaunce of hym & to knowe of his coūsell.
7179,And thus it befel that the forsayd Edmonde prayed specyally to tel hym pryuely of his lorde his brother syr Edward / yf that he lyued or were deed / & yf he were alyue he pray∣ed hym ones to haue a syght of hym.
7180,And this syr Iohn̄ Daueryl was a hygh herted mā & ful of courage / & answerde shortly to syr Edmond & sayd / that syr Edwarde hys brother was in helth.
7181,& vnder hys kepynge.
7182,& durst not shewe hym vnto no man syth it was defended him in the kyngys halfe Edwarde / yt was Edwardes sone of Carnuariuan & also by the cōmaunde∣ment of quene Isabel ye kynges moder / & of syr Roger Mortymer / that he sholde shewe hys bo¦dy to noo mā of the world sauf only to thē vpō lyf & lym̄e & disherytynge of his heyres for euer more.
7183,But the fals traytour falsly lyed.
7184,For he was not in his warde / but was take thēs and lad to the castell of Berkeley by syr Thomas of gurney by the cōmaūdemente of Mortymer tyll he was dede as before is sayd / But syr Ed¦monde of wodstok wyst no thynge that syr ed∣warde his brother was deed / wherupon he to∣ke a letter vnto kyng Edward his brother as to his worthy lorde & receyued ye letter of hym and behyght hym ryght faythful to do his mes¦sage without fayll.
7185,And with that syr Edmon¦de toke leue of the forsayd Iohn̄ / and yede into his owne coūtre & lordshyp in kent that he had there.
7186,Anone as this same Iohan wist.
7187,that syr Edmonde was gone into Kent his owne lord¦shyp.
7188,anone he went in all ye hast that he myght fro the Castell of Corf & came vnto syr Roger Mortymer and toke hym the letter that syr Ed∣mond of wodstok erle of Kent had taken hym closyd and ensealed with his owne seale / And whan syr Roger Mortymer had receyued the letter / he vnclosed it / and sawe that was con∣teyned therin / & began it to rede.
7189,wherof the be∣gynnynge was this.
7190,¶Worshyppes and reue¦rence wyth brother alyegaunce & subieccyon / syr knyʒt worshypfull & dere brother yf it you please I praye you hertely that ye be in gode cō¦forthe / for I shall soo ordeyn for you yt ye shall come out of prysō & be delyuered of that dysese that ye ben in / and vnderstondyth of your gre∣te lordshyp / that I haue to myn assentynge all moost all the grete lordes of Englonde wyth all theyr apperyll / that is to say wyth armour with tresour wythout nombre / for to maynte∣ne your quarell so ferforth / that ye shall be kyn¦ge agayn as ye were before / and that they ha∣ue sworne to me vpon a boke / and aswell prela¦tes as erles and barons.
7191,¶Whan syr Roger Mortymer saw & vnderstode / the myght and the strenth of the letter anone his hert for wra∣the began to boll and euyll herte bare to ward syr Edmōde of wodstok that was erle of kent.
7192,and wyth all the hast that he myght / he wente vnto dame Isabell the quene / that was ye was the kynges moder / & shewed her syr Edmonds letter / his wyll and his purpose and how that he had coniected & ordeyned to put downe kyn∣ge Edwarde of wyndsore her sone.
7193,of his ryal¦te and of his kyngdome / Nowe certes syr Ro∣ger sayd she hathe syr Edmonde done so now by my faders soule sayde she / I wyll be therof auenged / yf that god graunte me lyf / and that in a shorte tyme.
7194,And with that quene Isabell wente vnto kynge Edwarde her sone / there he was att the parlemente at wynchestre.
7195,to haue amende the wrongys and the trespasses that were done amonge the people of hys reame / & tho she toke and shewed hym the letter that syr Edmond of wodstok had made / and ensealed with hys owne seale and badde hym vpon her blessynge.
7196,that he sholde be auengyd vpon syr edmond as vpon his dedely enmye.
7197,Tho was the quene sore wrothe to warde syr Edmonde erle of Kente.
7198,And sessyd neuer to praye vntyll her sone / tyll that he had sente in all the hast af¦ter hym.
7199,And vpon that the kynge sent by hys letters after syr Edmoode of wodstok / that he sholde come & speke wyth hym att wynchestre all manere thinge left.
7200,And whan syr edmond sawe that the kynge sente after hym wyth hys letters ensealed / ye hastyd hym in alle yt he my∣ghte tylle that he came to wynchestre.
7201,¶But whan the quene wyst that syr Edmonde was come to wynchestre tho anone she prayed and so faste wende vnto kynge edwarde her sone / that the good erle was arested anone / and lad¦de vnto the barre before Robert of Hamonde that was Coroner of the kynges housholde.
7202,And he assocyed vnto hym syr Roger Morty∣mer.
7203,And tho spake the for sayd Roger and say¦de syr edmonde erle of Kent / ye shall vnderstō¦de that it is done vs to wyte / and pryncypally vnto our lyege lorde the kynge edwarde of en¦glonde almyghty god hym saue and kepe / that ye be his deedly enmye / and a traytoure / and also a comune enmye to the reame and that ye haue ben aboute many a day.
7204,For to make pry¦ue delyueraunce of syr edwarde somtyme kyn∣ge of englonde your broder / the whiche somty¦me was put downe of hys ryaltee by ye comyn assent of the lordes of englond / in peasynge of our lorde the kynges estate / and also of his rea¦me.
7205,¶Tho answerd the good man and sayd / For soth syr vnderstonde well that I was ne∣uer traytoure to my kynge / ne to the reame / & that I doo me on god / and on all the worlde / & therfore by my kynges leue.
7206,I shalle it preue & defende as a man ought for to do.
7207,¶Tho say∣de Mortymer.
7208,it is so ferfor the knowe that it may not be well gaynsayd / and that in presence of all that here been.
7209,it shalle be well prouyd.
7210,Now had this fals mortymer the same letter that syr edmonde hadde take to Syr Iohan Daueryll in the castell of Corf for to take to kynge edwarde hys brother that syr Edmonde wyst not of ne supposed no thynge that syr Iohn̄ Daueryll had be so fals to dely∣uer his letter in suche wyse vnto Mortymer.
7211,And thought no manere of thynge of that let∣ter.
7212,Thenne Mortymer sayd to syr edmonde / and shewed a letter sealed.
7213,& axed hym yf that he knewe ye letter and ye seale.
7214,This syr edmon¦de lokyd theron / & auysed hym longe tyme on the prynte of the seale / for he myght not see the letter with in.
7215,and wyst well that it was his se∣ale / & thought that it had be somme letter that had bore no grete charge / & thought no thinge of that other letter.
7216,And sayd openly in heryn∣ge of them all / ye for soth thys is my seale.
7217,and I wyll it not for sake.
7218,¶Lo sayde the Morty∣mer / syres ye here al what he hath sayd / & that he knowlegyth hym that this is his letter & hys seale.
7219,And now ye shall here what is conteyned therin / & thenne Mortymer openyd the letter that he had folde tofore togyder.
7220,& redde it open¦ly worde by worde in herynge of theym all / & whan the letter was redde / he sayd / Loo syres ye haue herde alle ye herin is wrytē / and that he hath knowlegyth that this is his letter & his se¦ale.
7221,& he may not go therfro / And thenne they cryed & yaue dome / that he sholde be hangyd & drawen / & hys heed smyten of in a manere of a traytour & he & hys heyres dysheryted for euer more / & so he was ladde forth and put in to pry¦son.
7222,and whan this was done.
7223,& the quene wist that he was dampned by way of lawe / both of lyf and of lym̄e / & hys heyres dysheryted for e∣uermore.
7224,thrugh open knowlegynge in playn∣court / where them thought that it were good / that the forsayd syr Edmond were hastyly slay¦ne / wythout wyttynge of the kyng / or elles the kynge wolde lyghtly foryeue hym hys dethe / & thenne it shode torne theym so moche sorowe / so as he was empechyd / And anone the quene thrugh counseyll of the Mortymer / and wyth out ony other counsell sent in hast to the Bay¦lyfe of wynchestre that they sholde smyte of Syr Edmondes heed Erle of Kente wythout ony manere abydynge or respyte vpon payne of lyf and lymme.
7225,And that he sholde haue no¦ne other execusyon / By cause of caryenge not withstandynge the Iugement.
7226,Tho toke the Baylyes syr edmonde out of pryson / and lad∣de hym besyde the castell of wynchestre / & the∣re they made a gonfermer smyte of hys heed / for none other durste it doo / and soo he deyed there / alas the whyle.
7227,That is to say the tenth daye of Octobre / the thyrde yere of kynge Ed¦warde regne.
7228,¶And whan the kyng wist ther¦of / he was wonder sory / and lete entyere hym at the frere Mynors at wynchestre.
7229,¶Of the deth of syr Roger Mortymer Erle of Marche.
7230,ANd so it befell at that tyme that syr Ro¦ger Mortymer erle of ye Marche / was so proude and so hauteyne that he helde no lor∣de of the reame his pere.
7231,And tho became he so coueytous / that he folowed dame Isabell the quenes courte that was kynge Edwards mo∣der and beset hys peny worth with the offycers of the quenes house holde in the same manere that the kynges offycers dyde.
7232,And so he made his takynge / as touchynge of vytayle and also of caryages / and all he dyde for bycause of ex∣pencys / and to gadre tresoure / And so he dyde without nombre in all that he myght.
7233,¶Tho had he made hym wonder preuy wyth the que∣ne Isabell / And so moche lordshyppe and rete we had / that all the grete lordes of Englonde of hym were adrad wherfore the kyng and his counseylle / to warde hym were agreued / And ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym thorou∣ghe pure reason and lawe for cause that kynge Edwarde that was ye kȳges fader traytoursly thrugh hym was murdred in the castel of Corf as before is sayde more playnly in some parte of his boke / of his deth.
7234,¶And some that were of the kynges counseyll louyd Mortymer / & tol¦de hym in preuyte / how that ye kynge & counsel were aboute from daye to daye / hym for to dy∣stroye and vndo wherfore Mortymer was so¦re anoyed & angry as the deuyll ayenst them of the kynges counseyll / & say he wolde of them be auenged / how so euer he toke on.
7235,¶It was not longe afterwarde / that kynge Edward & dame Phylyp his wyf / & dame Isabell the kyn¦ges moder.
7236,and syr Roger Mortymer / ne wen∣te vnto Notyngham there for to soiurne / And so it befell that quene Isabel thrugh coūseyll of Mortymer / toke to her the keyes of the yates of the castell of Notyngham.
7237,So that no man myght come nother in ne out but thrugh com∣maundement of Mortymer / ne the kynge / ne none his coūseylle.
7238,¶And that tyme it fel.
7239,that the Mortymer as a deuyll for wrath bolled / & also for wrathe that he had ayenst the kynges men Edward / and pryncypally ayenst theym that had hym accusyd to the kynge / of the deth of syr Edwarde his fader.
7240,¶And pryuely a coū¦seyll was take bytwene quene Isabell and the Mortymer and the bysshop of Lyncoln & syre Symōde of Bedford / and syr Hugh of Trom∣pyngton / & other preuy of theyr counseyll / for to vndo theym all that the Mortymer had ac∣cusyd vnto the kynge of his faders deth / of tre¦ason & of felonye.
7241,¶Wherfore all tho that we∣re of the kynges coūseyll / whan they wist of the Mortymers castynge: pryuely came to kynge Edwarde and sayd / that Mortymer wold the¦ym dystroye / bycause that they had hym accu∣syd of kynge Edwardes dethe.
7242,his fader \ And prayed hym that he wolde mayntene them in theyr ryght.
7243,¶And thyse were the lordes that pursued this quarell / Syr wyllyam of Moun¦tagu / syr wyllyam de Bohum / Syr wyllyam his broder / syr Rauf Stafforde / syr Robert of Herforde / syr wyllyam of Clynton / syr Iohan Neuell of Hornby and many other of theyr cō∣sent.
7244,And all thyse swore vpon a boke to mayn¦tene the quarell / in as moche as they myghte.
7245,And it befell so after· that syr wyllyam Moun∣tagu ne none of the kynges frendes muste not be herberowed in the castell for the Mortyme but went and toke theyr herberowe in dyuerse place of the twone of Nothyngham.
7246,And tho were they sore a ferde / leest that mortymer shol¦de theym dystroye.
7247,And in haste they came vn¦to kyng Edward syr wyllyam of Mauntagu and other that were in the castell.
7248,And pryuely hym tolde / that he ne none of hys cōpany.
7249,shol¦de not take the Mortymer.
7250,without counseyll & helpe of wyllyam of Elande.
7251,constable of the same castell.
7252,¶Now truelye sayd the kynge I loue you well· & therfore I counseyl you that ye go to the forsayd conestable / & commaūde hym in my name / that he be your frende and youre helpe / for to take the mortymer / al thynge yleft vpon peryll of lyf & lym̄e.
7253,¶Tho sayd Moun¦tagu Syr my lorde graunt mercy ¶Tho wen¦te forthe the forsayd Mountagu / and came to the Conestable of the castell / and tolde hym the kynges wyll.
7254,¶And he answerde and sayde· The kynges wyll sholde be doone in as moche as he myghte.
7255,and that he wolde not spare for no manere of dethe / And that he swore and ma¦de his othe.
7256,¶Tho sayde syr wyllyam of Moū∣tagu to the constable / in herynge of them alle.
7257,that were helpynge to the same quarell.
7258,Now certes dere frende / vs behouyth to werke & do by your aduys for to take the Mortymer / syth that ye be keper of the castell.
7259,and hath the key¦es in your warde.
7260,¶Syr sayd the Constable / wyll ye vnderstonde / that the castell yates ben lockyd with the keyes that dame Isabell sent hyther.
7261,and by nyght she hath the keyes ther of and layeth them vnder the lursell of the bedde vnto the morowe.
7262,and so ye maye not come in to the castell by the yates / by no manere of wy¦se / But I knowe an aleye that stretchythoute of the warde vnder the erthe in to the for sayde castell / that gothe in to the weste.
7263,whiche aleye dame Isabel the quene / ne none of her men ne the Mortymer / ne none of his company kno∣with it not.
7264,And so I shall lede you thrugh ye a∣ley / & so ye shall come in to the castell withoute aspyenge of ony man yt are your enmyes.
7265,And the same nyghe syr wyllyam Mountagu / & all the lordes of his quarell / & the same Constable also went theym to hors / & made semblaūt as it were for to go out of Mortymers syght But anone as Mortymer harde thys tydynges / he wende yt they wolde haue gone ouer see for fere of hym.
7266,¶And anone ryght he & his cōpanye toke a coūseyll amonge theym for to lete theyr passage / & snetelletters anone to the porters so that none of the grete lordes sholde go home to theyr owned coūtrees / but yf they were arested & take.
7267,And amonge other thynges wyllyam Elande Conestable of the for sayd castell.
7268,pry∣uely ladde syre wyllyam of Mountagu & hys company by the for sayd waye vnder the erth / tyll they came in to the castell & went vp in to the toure that Mortymer was in.
7269,But syr Hu¦ghe of Trompynton theym ascryed hydously and sayd a traytours it is all for nought.
7270,that ye ben comyn in to this castell ye shall deye yet an euell dethe euerychone.
7271,And anone one of theim that was in Mountages company vp wyth a mace / and smote the same Hugh vpon the heed / that the brayne braste out and fell on the grounde / and soo was he deed of an euyll deth.
7272,¶Tho toke they mortymer as he armyd hym at the toures dore / whan he herde the noy¦se of theym for drede.
7273,¶And whan the quene Isablell sawe that the Mortymer was taken she made moche sorowe in herte / & thyse wor∣des vnto theym she sayd / Now fayre syres / I praye you that ye doo noo harme to his body a thy knyght our welbeloued frende and our de¦re cosyn.
7274,¶Tho wente they thens / and came and brought Mortymer / and presentyd hym vnto kynge Edwarde / & he commaunded to brynge hym in saue warde.
7275,¶But anone as they that were consentynge vnto mortymers doynge / herde tell that he was taken they wen¦te & hydde them / and pryuely by nyght wente out of the towne eche one his waye / with heuy herte and mornynge chere & lyued vpon theyr londes as well as they myghte.

7278,¶But after warde was the Mortymers lyfe examy∣ned at westmestre before the kynge / and befo∣re all the geate lordes of Englonde / for peryll that myght falle to the reame / And to enquer also whiche were consentynge to syr Edwar∣des dethe the kynges fader / & also thrugh who¦me the Scottes escaped fro Stanhope in scot¦londe / without leue of kynge Edwarde.
7279,And also how ye chartre of ragman was delyuered vnto the Scottes them the homages and feau¦tees of the lordes of Scotlōde were conteyned that the Scottes sholde doo euer more to the Englysshe kynge for the reame of Scotlond / wherfore he was Iugyd to be drawen and han¦gyd for his treason / And this myscheyf came vnto hym on saynt Andrewes euen.

7292,And the Scottes sythe thrugh theyr falsnesse / warred vpon the good kynge Edwarde.
7293,And whan syr Iohan Bayloll kynge of Scotlonde sawe all this / he wente ouer see vnto Dunpier and lyued there vpon hys londes as well as he myght.
7294,tyll that ye Scottes wolde amende the∣ym of theyr mysdedys and trespaas / and ladde with hym syr Edwarde his sone.
7295,wherfore the Scottes in dyspyte of hym callyd hym syr Io¦han Turnlabard / for bycause that he wolde not ne offend ne trespaas ayenst the good kyn∣ge Edwarde of Englonde.
7296,And soo he for soke hys reame of Scotlonde / and sette therof but lytyll pryce.
7297,And this syr Iohan dwellyd longe tyme in Fraunce / tyll that he deyed there & syr Edward his sone receyued hys herytage / and dyde homage to the kynge of Fraunce / for his londes of Dunpier / And so it befell afterwar∣de / that Edward that was Iohan Bayllols so¦ne / had with hym a squyre of Englond yt was in yorke shyre / that was callyd Iohan of Bar¦naby / and this Edwarde Bayllol louyd hym moche / and was nyghe hym / & full preuy.
7298,And so this Iohn̄ of Barnaby was in debate with a Frenche man in the towne of Dunpier / & so he slewe hym and wente hys way in all the ha∣ste that he myghte in to the castell.
7299,For to haue socoure and helpe of hys lorde.

7340,brake ye brydges that they had made ouer the water of Erne.
7341,so that Bayllol myght not go ouer / wherfore he lodged hym there all that nyght / but lytyll hede he toke of reste.
7342,and say∣de vnto his people / Now dere lordes ye know full well.
7343,that ben now lodged bytwene our en¦myes / and they maye vs hampre / there is noo bote but dethe.
7344,wherfore yf we abyde stylle all this nyght· I wene it shall torne vs to moche harme.
7345,For the power of Scotlonde may eue∣ry wexe and encrece and we maye not so doo.
7346,And we ben but lytylle people ayenste theym wherfore I praye you for the loue of almyghty god make we vs bolde and hardy and that we may myghtely take the Scottes this nyght / & boldly werre vpon theym.
7347,and lete vs pursue theym thys nyghte.
7348,And yf they be trauaylled thorugh vs.

7350,other Scot∣tes that see them so traueylled and wery· the so¦rer woll they be adradde with vs to fyght and fyersly thenne shall we fyght with them.
7351,And on them pursue.
7352,Soo that thrughe the grace of god / all the worlde shall speke of the doughty∣nes of our chyualry.
7353,¶And syres vnderston¦deth wel that all the companye that came with syr Robert Baylloll / graunted well vnto that counseyll / and were therof ryght gladde.
7354,and anone pursued vppon the Scottes.
7355,that they became wonder wery.
7356,And Baylloll & his com¦pany sore folowed them / and dyde them mo∣che harme and sorowe / thrugh ther assente.
7357,so that thy myght not for feblynesse theym helpe and for lytyl people.
7358,¶But tho sayd the Scot¦tes amonge them / what is nowe befall that so lytyll a people as Baylloll hath in wynge doth vs so moche traueyll and sorowe Now certes it semyth vs that he werketh by grace / for he is wonder gracyous in hys quarell and we cer¦tes shall be dede or that we maye come to hym vs for to yelde Sith that his fader sete of vs no pryce.
7359,¶And amonge alle hys other thynges Baylloll and his people passed the water of Er¦ne so that Robert Swynerton the sone was fy¦ers and angrye / and wente forthe and they sa∣we people of armys full well arayed.
7360,and forth they wente vnto them and wyth them faught And slewe and toke as many as wolde abyde: And neuertheles at that assewte they wende it had be the grete hoste of Scotlond.
7361,And whan it came to the morowe.
7362,they gadred theym to∣gyder / and restyd theym a whyle· ¶And why¦le the Englysshemen rested them / the noble ba¦ron Thomas Vescy / and the noble barō / Staf¦forde / pryckyd theyr hors vp and downe by the hylles / for to kepe the estrees of the countree / & as they pryckyd vp and downe.
7363,they saw a gre¦te host of gode araye ordeyned in theyr wynge with helmes and sheldes shynynge comynge v¦pon them.
7364,and then̄e came tho two barōs ayen vnto Bayllols folke / & sayd.
7365,Now for the loue of god almyghty be of good cōforth for ye shall haue batayll an one ryght.
7366,¶And tho spake syr fouk the sone of Garenne· a baran of greate renowne and of dedys of armys / Syres vnder¦stonde what I wyll saye / I haue seen many dy¦uers wynges / as well amonge sarasyns and Iewes / as amonge the Scottes / and yet sawe I neuer the fourthe parte of the wynge fyght.
7367,& therfore yf ye wyl abyde our enmyes / we ben ynough for them.
7368,but yf we be not of gode her¦te and of good courage we been but loste.
7369,And therfore for the loue of god.
7370,take to vs gode her¦te / and lette vs be bolde / ad thynke we neuer of our wyues ne of oure chyldren / but only to cō¦quere our enmyes in batayll.
7371,¶And thrugh the helpe of our lorde we shall them ouercome And wyth that came the hoste of the Scottes to warde theym full serely / and ayenst syr Ed¦warde Baylloll in thre bataylles well arayed in armoure.
7372,¶And wonder fyersly they came to warde the Bayllols company / But whan syr Donald erle of Marcell that was with the Scottes / sawe all this / he sayd vnto Roberte Brus the sone of Robert the Brus thyse wor¦des / Syr Robert sayd he full fore me for thyn¦kyth att my herte / that thyse people that Bayl¦loll hathe brought wyth hym sholde deye wyth dyte of Scottes swerdes / sythe that they ben crysten men as we ben.
7373,And therfore me thyn¦kyth that it were grete charyte for to sende vn∣to theym / for to yelde theym / vnto our mercy / and raunsomme theym vnto greuous raun∣somme / for as moche as they haue taken oure londes and done yll.
7374,Now certes sayd syr Ro¦berte the Brus / I haue well rerceyued / that thou arte an enmye and a traytour vnto Scot¦londe / sythe that thou wylte consente to saue our dedely enmyes / that haue done vs moche sorowe and shame & now it semyth wel that ye be of theyr assente Now certes Robert sayde syr donald / falsly ye lye.
7375,I am not of theyr com¦pany ne of theyr consent / & yt hastyly ye shall se for I wyll fyze wyth them rather than ony of thys company / & certes syr Robert sayd he I shall in mauger of thy hede assayll they or thou And wyth yt they pryckyd theyr stedys fyesly vpon Gaskemore.
7376,and theyr wynge theym fo¦lowed on a reng.
7377,& tho came they & mette wyth Baylloll & hys cōpany at an hangynge bough of the more ī a strayte passage & so fast they has¦tyd thē vnto ye Englysshmen ye thousand / felle vnto the grounde echone ouer vpon other into an hepe hors and man bayllol & his men mygh¦tyly stode ayenst theym / & fast slewe the Scot∣tes to the grounde / and many they wounded / soo longe / tyll that they stode vpon theym and foyned theym wyth theyr swerdes and speres thrughe theyr bodyes / and fulle sore they were trauaylled vppon theym / tylle that they beca∣me wonder wery / and wyste not what for too doo.
7378,And the Scottes that were lete alyue fledde awaye / for to saue them selfe in the beste manere that they myght.
7379,And tho pursued the¦ym syre Edwarde baylloll and hys men / and slewe of theym tyll it was nyght.
7380,And fro thēs they wente to Saynt Iohannes towne / and toke it.
7381,& helde them there and vytaylled them self at there owne wyll / for they foūde ynough wherwith to make mery.
7382,Tho made Baylloll his men yt were wonded goo to shyp / to sayll in to Englonde / to hele ther woundes.
7383,& in ye tyme there was a flēmynge in the see.
7384,a stonge theyf And a robber that was callyd crab & this flēmī¦ge was dryuen out of Flaundres for hys wyc∣kydnesse & therfore he came into Scotlond to holde with the scottes / & dyde as moche harme to the Englysshmen as he myght do.
7385,And thys Crabbe mette Bayllols men in ye see that were woūded before in batayll yt were sent ayen in∣to Englonde.
7386,for to hele theyr woundes.
7387,and this crabbe yaaf to theym a gete assawte.
7388,and wold haue slayne theym euery chone.
7389,But the Englysshmen defended them well & manly & dyscomfyte Crabbe & his company & tho gan he fle into Scotlond.
7390,¶And as he cam towar¦de saynt Iohānes towne / he foūde a grete con∣pany of scottes / yt were come ayen togyder af∣ter the dyscomfyture at Gaskemore.
7391,the why∣che byseyged Bayllol and hys men ī the same towne of saynt Iohan· And anone tolde tolde the Scottes how that he was dyscomfyted of the Englysshmen / yt were woundyd at Gaske¦more / that went towarde Englonde / forts he¦le theyr woundes / And sayd to the Scottes / yt they sholde haue nother power ne myghte ne grace ayenst Edwarde Bayllol / by cause that he scomfyted / & empeyred alle the chyualry of Scotlond with a handfall of men as to ōpte ayenst the Scottes that were slayne.
7392,wherfore he coūseylled to remeue the sege from saynt Io¦hannes towne / & kepe theym in the best mane¦re that they myght.
7393,¶The Scottes vndersto¦de that crabbe sayd sothe / for soke the sege and wente thens by nyghte.
7394,¶whan thys thynge was knowe thrughe Scotlonde how that the lordes & knyghtes were dyscomfyted at Gas∣kemore of Scotlonde thrughe syre Edwarde Bayllol / ye shall vnderstonde yt the lordes & la¦dyes / & the gentyls of Scotlond came wonder faste to saynt Iohannes towne / & yeldyd the∣ym vnto Bayllol.
7395,& to hym dyd homage & feau¦te for theyr sondes & yelde theym to his peas & he theym receyued frely / And fro thens he wē¦te to the abbay of Scone.
7396,& there he was crow¦ned kyng of Scotlond / & after he lete crye hys peas thrughe out all the londe.
7397,¶And at that same tyme it befell that kynge Edwarde helde his parlement amonge hys leyges at the newe castell vpon Tyne for to amende the trespaces and the wronges that had ben done in his lon∣de.
7398,And syr Edwarde Bayllol kynge of Scot¦londe came to hym thyther / and dyde to hym homage & feautee / for the reame of Scotlond And in thys maner kynge Edwarde of Eng∣londe gadred ayen hys homages & feautees of Scotlonde / wher of he was put out / thrughe counseyll and assent of dame Isabell hys mo∣der / and of syr Roger Mortymer erle of Mar¦che / Tho toke Bayllol kyng of Scotlond hys leue of kynge Edwarde of Englonde / & went thens in to his owne londe of Scotlonde & set but lytyll by suche as had counseylled hym / & holpen hym in hys quarel / wherfore they wen¦te from hym & went & lyued by theyr owne lon¦des and renttes in Scotlond.
7399,¶And so it befel after warde not longe / that that the kynge of Scotlonde ne remeued & came to the toure of Anande & there tooke hys dwellynge / and thy∣der came to hym a company of knyghtes stron¦ge men & worthy / & yelded them vnto the kyn∣ge.
7400,And bare theym so fayr in dede and in coū∣tenaūce / so that he trustyd moche vpon theym And anone as the traytours sawe that he tru∣styd moche vpon theym / they ordened amon¦ge theym fyfty in a company / and wolde haue slayne theyr lorde the kynge / But thrugh the grace of almyghty god / he brake thrugh a wal¦le an hole in his chambre / & as god wolde sca∣pyd theyr trechery / & all hys men were slayne / and he escaped with moche dred vnto the tow¦ne of Cardoyll / And there he helde hym sore a∣noyed.
7401,And this befell vpon our ladyes euen ye cōcepcyon.
7402,¶Tho sent kynge Edward Bayl¦loll to kynge Edwarde of.

7404,And prayed hym for ye loue of god that he wolde mayntene hym & helpe hym ayenst hys enmyes.
7405,the kyn∣ge of englond had of hym grete pyte / & behight to helpe hym & socour hym.
7406,and sēt hym worde that he shold hold hym in peas styll in ye forsay¦de cyte of Cardoyll / tyll yt he had gadred his po¦wer.

10098,Now it is to de¦clare how the Pyctes were dystroyed & sayled.
10099,Brytayn was somtyme occu∣pyed with Saxons / & peas was made and sta¦blysshed with the Pyctes / thenne the Scottes that came with the Pyctes sawe that the Pyc¦tes were nobler of dedes & better mē of armes though they were lasse in nombre than the scot¦tes Then̄e the Scottes hauynge therof enuye torned to theyr naturall treason yt they haue oft vsed for in treason they passe other mē and ben traytours as it were by kynde.
10100,For they pray¦ed all the Pyctes & specyally the grete of them to a feest.
10101,& wayted her tyme whan the Pyctes were mery & had well dronke they drew vp nay¦les that helde vp holowe bēches vnder the pyc∣tes & the pyctes vnware sodaynly fyll in ouer the hammes into a wonderfull pytfull.
10102,Then the Scottes fell on the Pyctes and slewe thē & left none alyue.
10103,And so of two maner people ye better warryours were holy destroyed.
10104,but the other yt ben the Scotes whiche ben traytours all vnlyke to the pyctes toke prouffyte by that fals treason / for they tooke alle that londe and holde it yet vnto thys tyme and it.
10105,Scotlonde after hyr owne name / In kynge Edgars tyme Kynadin Alpinus sone was duke and leder of the Scottes and warred in Pycte londe / and destryyed the Pyctes.
10106,He warred syx sythes in Saxon and tooke all the londe that is bytwe∣ne Twede and the Scottysshe see with wron∣ge and wyth strengthe.

10110,Sou¦therne Northern & myddell speche in the myd¦dell of the londe as they come of thre maner of people.
10111,Netheles by commixyon and mydlynge fyrste with Danes & afterwar∣de with Normans in many thynges the coun¦tree langage is appared / for some vse straunge wlaffynge chyterynge harrynge gartynge and grysbytynge.
10112,¶This apparynge of the lan¦gage cometh of two thynges / one bycause that chyldren that gone to scole lerne to speke fyrste Englysshe / and than ben compelled to constre hys lessōs in Frensshe & that haue ben vsed syn the Normans come into Englonde.
10113,Also gen∣tylmens chyldren be lerned and taught frome theyr youthe to speke Frensshe / & vp londessh∣men wyll counterfete and lyken hymself to gē∣tylmen and are besy to speke / frensshe for to be more sette by / wherfore it is sayde by a comyn prouerbe.

10115,This was mo¦che vsed to fore grete deth.

10122,It semeth a grete wonder ye Englysshmen haue so grete dyuersy¦te in theyr owne langage in sowne & in spekyn¦ge of it whiche is all in one ylonde.
10123,And the lan¦gage of Normandye is comen out of an other londe & hath one maner sowne amonge all thē that speke it in Englonde / for a man of Kente southern western & northern men speken / fren¦she all lyke in sowne & speche but they can not speke theyr Englysshe soo.
10124,Nethe¦les there ben as many dyuerse maner of / fren∣she in the reame of / fraūce / as dyuerse Englys¦she in the reame of Englonde.
10125,Also of the forsayd tonge whiche is departed in thre is grete wonder / for men of the eest with men of the west accorde better in sownynge of the spe¦che / than men of the north with men of the sou¦the Therfore it is ye men of mercii that ben of myddell Englonde as it were partynes wyth the endes / vnderstond better the syde langages northern & southern than northern & southern vnderstonde eyther other.
10126,All the langahes of the northūbres & specy¦all at yorke is so sharpe shyttynge frottynge & vnshap / yt we southern men maye vnneth vn∣verstonde that langage· I suppose ye cause be yt they be nyght to the alyens that speke straunge¦ly.
10127,And also by cause the kynges of Englon¦de abyde and dwelle more in the southe counte¦ree than in the north countree.
10128,The cause why they abyde moore the south countre than in the north countree / is by cause that there is better corne londe more people moo noble cytees and mo profytable hauens in the southe countree than in the northe countree.

10406,In thys lond & wales olde wyues & wymmē were wōre & been yet as mē saye ofte to scape thēs in ly∣kees of hates for to mylke ther neyghbrs ine & stole her mylke & ofte gry hoūdes ren after thē & pursewen thē & weuen that they be hares Also some by crafte of Nygramācye t∣te swyne for to be reed of colour and selfe thē in markettes & fayres But as soone as these swy¦ne passe ony water they torne into theire owne kynde whether it be strawe hey gras of ues.
10407,But these swyne maye not be kept by no craft for tēdure in lykenes of swynes ouer thre daies Amōge these wonders & other take hede that in the vttermest ende of the worlde falleth newe meruaylles & wōders.
10408,As thoughe kynde play¦ed with large loue secretly and ferre in thendes than openly & nygh in the myddeell.
10409,therfore in this ylōde bē many gresely wōders & meruayl∣les.
10410,¶Of the meruaylles and wōders of Irlonde.
10411,MAny men tellen that in the northe syde of Irlonde is the londe of lyfe.
10412,In that ylonde no man maye deye but whan they ben olde and vexed wyth greate sykenes / they ben borne out in to the nexte londe and deye there.
10413,There is an other ylonde in Irlonde that noo womman ther in may bere a childe / but yet she may conceyue.
10414,Also there is an ylonde in why¦che no dede body maye roten.
10415,In vltonia that is Vlstre is an ylonde in a lake wōderly depar¦ted in twene In that one parte is grete dystur¦baunce and dyscomforth of frendes & in that other partye grete lykyng and comforth of ho¦ly angels There is also saynt Patryks purga¦tory that was shewed at hys prayer to confer∣me hys prechynge & hys lore whan he preched to mysbyleued men of sorowe and payne that euyll mē sho suffre for ther euyll werkes.
10416,And of Ioye and of blysse ye gode men shall receyue for ther holy dedes he telleth that who that suf∣freth the paynes of purgatory / yf it be enioy∣ned hym for penaunce he shall neuer suffre the paynes of hell / but he deye fynally withon re∣pentaunce of synne / as the ensample.
10417,is sette more full at this chapytre ende.
10418,But truly noman maye be saued but yf he be very repentaunce what someuer penaunce he do / and euery man that is very repentaunt as hys lyues ende shall be sekerly saued / though he neuer here of saynt Patryks purgatorye.
10419,There is an ylond in conate Sale / that is in ye see of Conaccia halowed by saynt Brandon yt hath no myse there dede bodyes ben not buryed but bē kept out of the erth & roten not.
10420,In Ma¦monia is a wel who yt wassheth hym with that water of ye welle he shall waxe / hore on his heed There is an other wel in Vltonia who someuer is wasshē therin he shall neuer wexe hore after warde / There is a welle in Mounstre or Ma¦monia \ yf ony mā touche that welle anone shal falle grete rayne in alle the prouȳce / & that ray¦ne shalle neuer cesse / tyll a preste that is a clene mayden synge a masse in a chapell that is faste by & blesse the water / & wyth mylke of a cowe yt is of one her besprynge the welle.
10421,& so reconcyle the welle in this staunge manere.
10422,At Glyndal can aboute the oratory of Saynt Keywyn wy¦ches beryth apples as it were apple trees and ben moore holsome than sauery.
10423,That holy sa¦ynt brought forthe these apples by prayers for to hele his shylde that was seke.
10424,There is a la∣ke in Vlstre and moche fysshe therin / whyche is .xxx.
10425,myle in lengthe and.
10426,The Ry∣uer Ban renneth out of that lake into the nor¦the Occean and mē saye that thys lake began̄e in this manere.
10427,There were men in that coun¦tree that were of euyll lyuynge coeuntes cūbru∣tis.
10428,And there was a well in that londe in gre¦te reuerence of olde tyme / And all waye coue∣red / yf it were lefte vncouered the welle wolde ryse and drowned all the londe.
10429,And soo it hap¦ped that a wooman wente to that welle for to fetche water & hyed her fast to her chyld yt wept in the cradell / & left the welle vncouered / then the welle sprange soo faste that is drowned the woman and her chylde & made all the countree a lake and a fysshe ponde.
10430,for to preue that thys is soo there it is greate argument / that whan the weder is clere / fysshers of that water see in the rounde vnder the water rounde toures and hyghe shapen as steples and chyrches of that londe.
10431,In the north syde of Irlonde in the coun¦tre of Ossyyryens euery .vii.
10432,yere at the prayer of an hooly Abbot / tweyne that ben wedded a man and a woman muste nedes be exyled and forshapen in to lyknes of wolues & abyde out .vii.

10434,yf they ly∣ue they come home agayne / And take agayne theyr owne shappe / And than shall other twey¦ne goo forthe in theyr stede and soo forshapen for other .vii.
10435,There is a lake in thys lon¦de yf a poole of tree pyghte and stycked therin that parte of the shafte or poole.
10436,That is in the erth shall torne in to yron / And that pare that abydeth in the water shalle torne into stone / And the parte that abydeth aboue shall be tree in his owne kynde.
10437,Also there is a lake that tor¦nethe hasell in to asshe and asshe in to hasell yf it be done therin.
10438,Also in Irlonde ben thre Sa¦mon lepes there as samons lepe ayenste a Ro∣che of longe speres lenthe.
10439,Also in Leginia is a pounde there ben seen colmans byrdes.
10440,The berdes been called certelles and come homely to mannes honde but yf men do hym wronge or harme.

10442,As touchynge Patryks purgatorye.
10443,ye shalle vnderstonde Saynt Pa¦tyrk that was abbote and not byshoppe why∣le he prechyd in Irlonde laboured and studyed for to torne thylke wycked men that lyued as beestes oute other euyll lyf for drede of paynes of helle / and for to conferme hem to good lyfe and they sayde they wolde not torne but some of theim myghte knowe som what of the grete paynes and also of the blesse that he spake of.
10444,Thenne saynt Patryk prayed to god almygh∣ty therfore / ouer lorde Ihesu Cryste appyered to saynt Patryk and toke hym a staffe & ladde hȳ in to a wylde place and shewed hym there a rounde pytte that was derke wythin and say∣de / that yf a man were very repentaunce and stable in byleue and wente into this pytte and walkede therin a daye and a nyghte he sholde see the lorowes and the paynes of euyll men / and the Ioye and blysse of good men.
10445,Thenne Cryste vanysshed oute of patryks syght and saynt Patryk arered and buylded there a chyr∣che and putte therin chanons reguler and ∣se the pytte aboute wyth a walle / and in the chyrche yerde at the eest ende chyr¦che and faste shette wyth a stronge .
10446,For noo man sholde nycely goo in wythout of the bysshoppe or the poyour of the place.
10447,¦ny men wente in and come out agayne in Pa∣tryks tyme and tolde of paynes and Ioye th they hadde seen / and the meruaylles that they sawe been there yet wryten / and by cause ther of many men torned and were conuerted to ry¦ghte byleue.
10448,¶And also many men went in cme neuer agayne.

11341,In this tyme began many kyngdomes / & the moost of all those kyngdomes was the kyngdome of Scitarū.
11342,But there were so many rude people in it yt the cite was no worshipped / yet was it a myghty re¦gyon of dystaūce.

11344,¶ Noblenes or gentylmen began about this sayd tyme And this noblenes or gentylmen was ordeyned for many causes.
11345,¶ The fyrst cause was necessite / for whā mankynde grewe sore / & men were prompte & redy to do hurt & domage to other / it was ve∣ry necessary to wtstande ye grete malyce of ye cursed and wycked people agaynst good & ryghtwyse men.

11349,¶ The seconde was ye dyuers worshyppyng of the people / for no man worshypped thā but as his naturall reason gaue / & they knewe not veryly what they shold wor¦ship / for they were so dull of wytte that they coude pondre no grete thynge / but that was publysshed by the comyn peo∣ple.
11350,Wherfore it was expediēt for theyr peace to be kepte that they sholde haue prynces of noble byrthe.
11351,¶ The thyrde cause {pro}cedeth of some singuler strength Many tymes ye comynaltees were gre∣ued through ennemyes comynge vpon them & than they sayd yt who someuer wōlde defende them fro those perylles / he sholde haue the right of noblenes for hȳm & for his heyres for euermore.
11352,And in this maner of wyse many are redde to be noble men.
11353,¶ The fourth cause of noblenes was haboundaūce of goodes.
11354,Somtyme ye people were holden with grete penury of meet & drynke / & than they toke them & theyrs to some ryche man / that through that couenaūt they sholde tempre ye grete straytnes of theyr honger / & after that they sholde knowe hym as theyr lorde & a noble man.
11355,Also there be foūde certayn noble men by the {pro}uysyon of god / though they were but fewe / of yt whiche som abode ī vertue as Dauyd / & some fayled anone / as Saul and Ieroboam.

11651,¶ Afore that I wyll speke of Brute it shall be shewed how the londe of englonde was fyrst named byon & for what cause it was so named.
11652,IN the noble londe of Sirrie there was a noble kynge & myghty & a man of grete renome yt was called Dio∣clesyan that well & worthely hȳ gouer∣ned & ruled through his noble chyualry So yt he conquered all the londes about hym / so that almoost all ye kynges of the worlde to hȳ were attendaūt.
11653,It befell thus yt this Dioclesian spoused a gētyll damoysel yt was wonders fayre / yt was his vncles doughter Labana / & she lo∣ued hym as reason wolde / so yt he gate on her .xxxiij.
11654,doughters / of yt whiche ye eldest was called Albyne / and these da∣moyselles whan they came vnto age be came so fayre yt it was wonder / whereof Dioclesian anone let make a somnynge & cōmaunded by his lettres that all the kynges yt helde of hym sholde come at a certayn daye as in his lettres were con∣teyned to make a feest royal.
11655,At whiche daye thyder they came / & brought with them admyrats / princes / dukes & noble chualry.
11656,The feest was royally arayed and there they lyued in ioye and myrth ynough yt it was wonder to wyte.
11657,And it befell thus ye Dyoclesyan thought to mary his doughters amonge all those kynges yt were at ye solempnite.
11658,And so they spake & dyd that Albyne his eldest doughter & all her systers rychely were maryed to .xxxiij.
11659,kynges yt were lordes of grete honour at this solempnite.
11660,And whan this was done euery kynge toke his wyfe & ladde them in to theyr owne coūtre / & there made them quenes.
11661,And it befell thus afterward yt this dame Al∣bine became so stoute & so sterne that she tolde lytel pryce of her lorde / & of hyȳ had scorne & despyte / & wold not do his wyll but she wold haue her owne wyll in dy¦uers maters.
11662,And all her other systers euerychone bare them so euyll agaynst theyr lordes yt it was wonder to wyte.
11663,And for as moche yt them thought that theyr husbondes were not of so hye pa∣rentage comē as theyr fader.
11664,But those kynges yt were theyr lordes wold haue chastysed them with fayre maner vpon al loue & frendshyp yt they shold amende theyr euyll condicyons.
11665,But all was for nought / for they dyd theyr owne wyll in all thynge yt them lyked & had of power Wherfore those .xxxiij.
11666,kynges vpon a tyme & often tymes bette theyr wyues For they wende that they wold hauea∣mended them & theyr tatches & wycked¦nes.
11667,But of suche condicions they were that for fayre speche & warnynge they dyd all ye worse / & for betynges eftsones moche the worse.
11668,Wherfore the kyng yt had wedded Albyne wrote the tatches and condicyons of his wyfe Albyne / & the lettre sent to Dyoclesyan her fader.
11669,And whan the other kynges herde that Albynes lorde had sente a lettre to Dio∣clesyan / anone they sente lettres sealed with theyr seales the condicyons & tat∣ches of theyr wyues.
11670,Whan the kynge Dioclesyan sawe & herde so many com∣playntes of his doughters / he was sore ashamed and became wonderssy angry and wroth toward his doughters / and thought how he myght amende it that they so mysoyd / & anone sent his lettres to the .xxxiij.
11671,kynges yt they sholde come to hym / & brynge wt them theyr wyues euerychone at a certayn day / for he wol¦de there chastyse them of theyr wycked¦nes yf he myght ī ony maner wyse.
11672,So that ye kynges came all at ye tyme & daye that tho was set bytwene hym and the kynges.
11673,Dioclesyan receyued them wt moche honour / & made a soleme feest vnto all that were vndernethe his lord∣shyp.
11674,And the thyrde daye after that so∣lempnite ye kynge Dioclesyan sent after his .xxxiij.
11675,doughters yt they shold come & speke with hym in his chambre.
11676,And whā they were come / he spake to them of theyr wyckednes & of theyr cruelte / & angerly them reproued & blamed & said to them.
11677,That yf they wolde not be cha¦stysed / they sholde lose his loue for euer∣more.
11678,And whan ye ladyes herde al this they became abasshed & gretly ashamed & sayd to theyr fader yt they wolde make all amēdes.
11679,And so they departed out of theyr faders chambre.
11680,And Albyne that was ye eldest syster ladde them all to her chambre / & tho made to voyde al yt were therin / so yt no psone was amonge them but she & her systers togyder.
11681,Thāsayd this Albyne.
11682,My fayre systers / well we knowe yt the kyng our fader vs hath re∣proued / shamed & despysed / for bycause to make vs obedyent to our husbondes but certaynly yt shall I neuer whyles ye Ilyue / syth that I am come of a more hyer kynges blode than myn husbonde is.
11683,And whan she had thus said / all her systers sayd ye same.
11684,And than sayd Al∣byne.
11685,Well I wote fayre systers / yt our husbondes haue cōplayned vnto our fa¦der vpon vs / wherfore he hath vs thus foule reproued & despysed / wherfore sy∣sters my coūseyle is yt this night whan our husbōdes ben a bedde / all we wt one assent to kytte theyr throtes / & than we may be peas of them / & better we may do this vnder our faders power thā ony where els.
11686,And anone all ye ladyes con∣sented & graūted to this counseyle.
11687,And whānyght was comen / the lordes & la¦dyes went to bedde.
11688,And anone as theyr lordes were aept / they kytte all theyr husbōdes throtes / & so they shewe them all.
11689,Whan Dioclesian theyr fader herde of this thynge / he became wroth ryght furyously agaynst his doughters / & a∣none he wole them all haue brent.
11690,But all the harons & lordes of Srrye coun∣seyled not so for to do suche straytnes to his owne doughters / but shold boyde ye londe of them for euermore / so that they neuer sholde come agayne / & so he dyd.
11691,And Dioclesyan yt was theyr fader ano¦ne cōmaūded them to go in to a shyppe / & delyuered to them itayles for halfe a yere.
11692,And whan this was done / all the systers wente in to the shyppe & sayled forth in ye see / & betoke all theyr frendes to Appolyn yt was theyr god & so longe they sayled in the see yll at the last they came & arryued in an yle yt was all wyl¦dernes.
11693,And whan dame yne was come to ye londe & all her systers this ¦byne went fyrst forth out of ye shyppe & sayd to her other systers.
11694,For as moche as I am ye eldest syster of all this cōpa∣ny / & first this londe haue take / & for as moche as my name is Albne / I wyl this londe be called Albion after my owne name.
11695,And anone all her systers graūted to her with a good wyll.
11696,Than went out of ye shyppe all ye systers & toke the londe Albion as theyr syster called it & there they went vp & downe & foūde neyther man ne woman ne chylde but wylde beestes of dyuers kyndes.
11697,And whan theyr ttayles were dispruded & sayled / they fedde them with herbes & fruytes in season of yt yere / & so they ∣ued as they best myght / & after yt they toke flesshe of dyuers beestes & bera wonders fae / & so they desyred mānes company / & mānes kynde them fayed.
11698,And for here they wexed wonders cou∣ragyous of kynde / so that they desyred more mannes company than ony other solace or myrth.
11699,Whan the deuyll yt per∣yued went by dyuers coūtries & toke a body of ye ayre / & lykyng natures sh of men / & came in to ye londe of Albion / & lay by those women & shad tho natures vpon them / & they conceyued & brought forth gyaūtes.
11700,Of whiche one was cal∣led Gogmagog / & another Langerigan And so they were named by dyuers na∣mes / & in this maner they came forth & were borne horryble gyaūtes in Albion And they dwelled in caues & in hylles at theyr wyll / & had the londe of Albion as them lyked / vnto ye tyme that Brute arryued & came to Totnes yt was in the yle of Albion / & there this Brute cōque∣red & discōfyted ye gyaūtes aboue sayd.
11701,¶ Explicit prima pars.
11702,¶ Here begȳneth now how Brute was goten / & how he slewe fyrst his moder / & after his fader.
11703,And how he conquered Albyon / that after he named Brytayne after his owne name / that now is called Englonde / after the name of Engyst of Saxonye.
11704,This Brute came in to Bry∣tayne aboute the .xviij.
11705,BE it knowen that in ye noble cite of grete Troy there was a noble knyght and a man of grete power that was called Eneas.
11706,And whan ye cite of Troy was lost & destroyed through them of Grece.
11707,This Eneas with all his meyny fledde thens & came in to Lombardy.
11708,And tho was lorde & gouernour of that londe a kyng that hyght Latyne.
11709,And another kynge there was ye hyght Turocelyne that strongly warred vpon this kynge Latyne / ye oftentymes dyd hym moche harme.
11710,And whan this kynge Latyne herde yt Eneas was come / he receyued hym with moche honour / & hym with helde for as moche as he had herd of hȳ and wyst well yt he was a noble knight and a worthy of his body & of his dedes This Eneas helped kynge Latyne in his wa / & shortly for to tell / so well & so worthely he dyd / that he slewe Turo∣celyne / & dyscomfyted hym & all his peo¦ple.
11711,And whan all this was done / kyng Latyne gaue all ye londe that was Tu∣rocelynes to this noble man Eneas i maryage with Lauyne his doughter the moost fayrest creature that ony man wyst.
11712,And so they lyued togyder in ioye and myrth all the dayes of theyr lyues.
11713,¶ And after Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a wyfe / and vpon her he gate a sone that was called Siluine.
11714,And this Siluyne whan he coude some reason of man vnwytyng his fader and agaynst his wyll acqueynted hym wt a damoy∣sel that was cosyn to Lauyne that was kynge Latynes doughter ye quene that was Eneas wyfe / and brought the da∣moysell with chylde.
11715,And whan Asca∣nius his fader it wyst / anone let enquy∣re of the wysest maysters and of the gre¦test clerkes what chylde the damoysell sholde brynge forth.
11716,And they answered and sayd / that she sholde brynge forth a sone that shold kyll bothe his fader and his moder.
11717,For his mo∣der dyed in berynge of hym.
11718,And whan this chylde was borne his fader let call hym Brute.
11719,And ye maysters sayd that he sholde do moche harme and sorowe in many dyuerse places / and after he sholde come to grete honour and wor∣shyp.
11720,This kyng Ascanius dyed whan god wolde / and Siluyne his sone recey¦ued the londe / and made hym wonder∣ly well beloued among his people.
11721,And so whā Brute that was Siluynes sone was .xv.
11722,yere olde he went vpon a daye with his fader for to playe & solace.
11723,And as Brute shold haue shotte vnto an hart his arowe myshapped & glanced / and so there Brute slewe his fader.
11724,¶ How Brute was dryuen out of the londe / & how he helde hym in Grece.
11725,ANd whan this mischaūce was befallen / all ye people of the londe made grete sorowe / and were sore dys∣pleased.
11726,And bycause therof they droue Brute out of ye londe / & wolde not suffre hym amonge them.
11727,And whan he sawe that he might not abyde there / he went from thens in to Grece / & there he foūde vij.
11728,thousande men that were of ye kyn∣rede of Troye / and were comen of grete blode as the story telleth / as of men and women & children / the whiche were all holden in thraldome & bondage of kyng Pandras of Grece / for ye deth of Achyl∣les that was betrayed & slayne at Troy This Brute was a wōders fayre man and a stronge & huge of his age / and of gladde chere & semblaūt / & also worthy of body / & was well beloued amōge his people.
11729,This kyng Pandras herde spe∣ke of his goodnes & condicyons / & anone made hym to dwell with hym.
11730,So that Brute became wonders preuy & moche beloued with ye kynge / & dwelled longe tyme with the kynge.
11731,So at ye last they of Troy & Brute spake togyder of kyn∣rede & lygnage & of acqueyntaūce / and there complayned them vnto Brute of theyr sorowe & of theyr bondage / and of many other shames ye kynge Pandras had done to them / & to Brute they sayd vpon a tyme.
11732,Ye be a lord of our lignage & a stronge man & a myghty / be ye our capytayne & gouernour / & we wyll be∣come your men / & fulfyll al your cōmaū dementes / & brynge vs out of this wret chednes & bondage / & we wyll fyght wt the kyng for trouth / with the grace of ye grete god we shall ouercome hym & we shall make you kynge of this londe / & to you do homage / & of you we shall holde for euermore.
11733,Brute had tho grete pyte of theyr bondage yt they were brought in / & pryuely went fro ye kynges courte / and tho that were of Troy went & put them in to woodes & in to moūtaynes / & helde them there / and sente vnto kynge Pandras that he sholde gyue them ly∣cence for to departe safely out of his lōde and kyngdom / for they wolde no longer dwell in his bondage.
11734,Whan kyng Pan¦dras herde this / he was sore vexed and anoyed / & tho sware that he wolde e them euerychone / and ordeyned a grete power / and went towardes them for to fyght with them.
11735,But Brute and his men manly them defended and fyersly fought / & slewe all the kynges men that none of them escaped / and toke ye kynge and put hym in pryson / and ordeyned a coūseyle amonge them selfe what they myght do wt the kynge.
11736,And some sayd that he sholde be put to deth / and some sayd that he sholde be exyled out of the londe / & some sayd yt he sholde be brent.
11737,And than spake a wyse knyght yt was called Mempris & sayd to Brute & to all them of Troy.
11738,Yf kyng Pandras wolde yelde hym & haue his lyfe / I coūseyle yt he gyue vnto Brute (that is our duke & our souerayn) his doughter Geog to wyfe / & in maryage with her an hon¦dred shyppes well arayed / & all his trea¦sour of golde & syluer / of corne & of wyne and as moche as we nede of one thynge & other / & than go we out of this londe and ordeyne vs a lōde els where / for we nor none of our kynrede yt come after vs shall neuer haue peas in this londe a∣monge them of Grece / for we haue ay∣ne so many of theyr knyghtes & of other frendes that euermore warre & dyscord shall be amonge vs.
11739,Brute tho & all his folke consented gladly to ye coūseyle / and this thȳge they tolde to kyng Pandras And he for to haue his lyfe / graūted as moche as they demaunded / and anone gaue vnto Brute the fayre lady Genno∣gen his doughter to wyfe / and an hon∣dred shyppes with as moche as them of all vytayles / as afore was or∣deyned.
11740,Thā Brute toke his wyfe & all his men that forsoke the londe of Grete & went to the see / & had wynde & weder at theyr wyll / & came the thyrde daye in to an yle that was called Logres.
11741,This Brute anone sent of his men to londe for to espye ye maner of ye coūtrce.
11742,And they founde an olde cite all wasted & forlet / so that there was neyther man nor womā therin dwellynge.
11743,And in the myddle of this cyte they foūde an olde temple of a fayre lady that was called Diane the goddesse.

13238,Thā this Conan Meriedok thanked hȳ curteysly / & so was he made kynge of lytell Brytayn.
13239,And whan all this was done Maximyan went from thens vnto Rome / and was than made emperour after Constantyne.

13246,And whā Dionothe vnderstode this / he made a cōmaūdement through out all the londe of Brytayn / & as many as the nombre came to he assembled to∣gyder of maydēs / for there was no man that durst withstande his cōmaūdemēt bycause he was protectour.
13247,And whan these maydens were assembled / he let them come before hym at London / & let ordeyne shyppes for them hastely / wt all that therto belonged.
13248,And toke his own doughter that was called Vrsula / that was ye fayrest creature y• ony man wyst And he wolde haue sent her to kyng Co¦nan yt shold haue spoused her & made her quene of ye londe.
13249,But she had made pry∣uely to god a vowe of chastite yt her fader wyst not / ne none other man lyuynge.

13255,And the kynge of the londe that was called Gowan was than in y• cite / & whan he wyst the tydynges that so many fayre maydens were there ar∣ryued / he toke Elga his broder & other of his housholde with hym and went to the shyppes to se that fayre company.
13256,And whan he sawe them so fayre / he & his cōpany wold haue ouerayen them and haue taken fro them theyr virgy∣te.
13257,But Vrsula that good virgyn coun∣seyled / prayed / warned / & taught then: that were her felawes / that they shol defend them with all theyr myght / and rather suffre deth than suffre theyr bo∣dyes to be defouled.
13258,So that all the vir∣gyns became so stedfast in god that they defended them through his grace that none of them had power to do them sha∣me.
13259,Wherfore kynge Gowan was sort anoyed / that he for wrathe slewe them euerychone anone ryght.
13260,And so were all those virgyns martyred for the our of god / and they lye at Coleyn.
13261,¶ How kynge Gowan came for to destroye this londe / and how a man of grete power that was called Gra¦cian defended the londe.
13262,WHan all this was done / kynge Gowan whiche was a sarasyn called to hym his broder Elga and sayd to hym that he sholde go and conquere the londe that all those fayre maydens were borne in.
13263,And thā he or∣deyned a grete power of Pehites of den¦marke / of Orkeney / & of Norway.
13264,And they came in to this londe & brent tow∣nes / & slewe folke / & cast down chirches & houses of religyon / & robbed the londe in length & brede / & put to deth all those that wolde not forsake ye ryght byleue & chrystēdom.
13265,For as moche as there was no souerayne yt myght helpe them.
13266,For the kyng Maximian had taken wt hym all ye worthy men whan he went to con∣quere lytell Brytayn.
13267,And in ye same ty∣me was saynt Albon martyred through the wode tyraūt Dioclesyan / in ye same place where is now an abbey made of saynt Albons / whyles yt he was a pay∣nym.
13268,But he was conuerted vnto god through the predycacyon of a clerke & a wyse man that was called Ancibel that was herborowed a nyght in his hous.
13269,And this was after ye incarnacion of Ie¦su Chryst .CC .xxvj.
13270,And it is to be vnderstāde that saint Albon suffred his martyrdom before saynt Edmond.
13271,And therfore is saȳt Albon called ye fyrst mar¦tyr of Englonde.
13272,¶ This Gowans bro∣der & his folke that were sarasyns went through out the londe and destroyed all thynge yt they founde & no thynge they spared.
13273,Whan these tydynges came to Rome how ye kynge Gowan had begon for to destroye this londe / the emperour & the Romayns sent a stronge man & of grete power yt was called Gracien with xxiiij.
13274,M. fyghtynge men / for to cast out of this londe all those sarasyns.
13275,And all they arryued at Portesmouth.
13276,Maxi∣mian myght not come himselfe bycause he was chosen emperour after the deth of Cōstantyne yt was saynt Eleyns sone Whan this Gracian was arriued with his hoost / he let espye pryuely where ye kynge Gowan myght be foūde / & he set vpō them sodeynly as they lay in theyr beddes / & discōfyted them & slewe them in theyr beddes euerichone / that none of them escaped: saue Gowan yt fledde in to his owne coūtre wt grete sorowe.
13277,Soone after it befell ye Maximyan was slayne at Rome through treason.
13278,And whan Gracian wyst of those tydynges / he let crowne hymselfe kynge of this londe.
13279,¶ How Gracian made him kyng whan Maximyan was slayne / & afterward ye Britons slewe hym for his wyckednes.
13280,THis Gracian whan he began to regne / he became so wycked and so sterne / and so moche sorow dyd to the Brytons that they slewe hym amonge them.
13281,Whan kyng Gowan vnderstode that Gracian was slayne / he assembled a grete power & came agayne in to this londe / and yf he had fyrst done harme than dyd he moche more.
13282,For he than destroyed all this londe and the chrysten people that were therin / so that no man was so hardy to name god / and yf they dyd they were put to straūge deth.
13283,But the bysshop of London yt was tho whi∣che was called Gosselyn scaped & went thens to them of Rome to seke socour to helpe to destroye the sarasyns that had destroyed this londe.
13284,And the Romayns sayd yt they had ben so often anoyed for theyr sendyng of folke in to Britayne all for to helpe the Britons / & they wold no more so do.
13285,And so the bysshop Gosselyn went thens without ony socour or hel∣pe.
13286,And than went he to ye kyng of lytell Brytayne yt was called Aldroie / & this was ye thyrde kyng after Gowan Me∣riedok / as before is sayd.
13287,The bysshop prayed this kynge Aldroie of helpe & so∣cour.
13288,And ye kynge had pite in his herte whan he herde how ye bysshop fledde / & how the chrysten men were so slayne in grete Brytayne through ye paynyms & sarasyns / he graūted hym Cōstantyne his broer for to helpe hym with power of folke.
13289,And cha dyd araye hors / har∣neys & shyppes & all thynge yt neded to that vyage.
13290,And whan all thynge was redy / he called ye bysshop & sayd to hym.
13291,I take you here Cōstantyne my broder vpon this couenaūt / yt yf god gyue hym grace to discōfyte ye infydelēs / that than ye shall make hym kyng.
13292,And ye bisshop graūted it wt a good wyll.
13293,Cōstantyne & the bysshop toke leue of ye kyng Aldroie / & betoke hym to god / & toke .xij.
13294,Minen & went to theyr shippes / & sayled towar¦de grete Britayn / & arryued at Totnes.
13295,Whan ye Britons herdethese tydynges that socour came / they were glad / & or∣deyned them an huge nōre of people / & went & receyued them wt moche honour ¶ Gowan anone as he wyst of these ty dynges / he assembled all his farasyns & came agaynst them & gaue thē batayle.
13296,And Cōstantyn slewe hym wt his owne handes / & all the other sarasyns were dyscomfyted & slayne yt none escaped / ex∣cepte those that were couerted to god.
13297,¶ How Constantyne that was the kynges broder of lytel Britayn was crowned kynge of grete Brytayne for his worthynes.
13298,ANone after ye batayle they went to London & crowned there Con¦stantyne kyng of this londe / & ye bysshop Gosselin set the crowne on his heed / and aoynted hȳ as it belongeth for a kyng.
13299,And thā began christēdom in this londe agayn.
13300,And anone after whā this kyng Constantyn was crowned he spoused a wyfe through roūseyle of ye Brytons / & begate on herthre sones.
13301,The fyrst was called Cōstance / ye seconde Aurilambros & the thyrde Vter.
13302,This Constance yt el∣der broder whā he came to o he hym a monke at Wynchestre.
13303,And Con¦stātyne theyr fader was slayne through treason.
13304,For it befell vpon a tyme that a Pehyte came to hym vpon a daye as it were on a message / & sayd that he wol∣de speke with the kynge pryuely in coū∣seyle.
13305,The kyng let oyde his chambre of the men that were there within / and there abode no moo but the kynge and the Pehite / and he made a countenaūce as though he wolde haue spoken with the kyng in his eere.
13306,And there he shewe hym with a longe knyfe.
13307,And after that he went meruaylously out of that cham¦bre in to an other chambre / so that at the last no man wyst where he was bro∣men.
13308,Whan the kynges men wyst that theyr lord was so deed / they made than so moche sorowe / yt they wyst not what for to do.
13309,For as moche as his two sones Aurilambros and Vter were so yonge / that none of them myght be kynge and the thyrde broder was a monke at chestre as is sayd before.
13310,But onger that was erle of Westler thought pry∣uely in his herte through some subrye for to be kynge hymselfe.
13311,And wente to Wynchestre where as Constance was monke / & sayd to hym.
13312,Cōstance qued be your fader is deed / & your two brethern that ben wt Gosselyn the bysshop of Lon¦don to nourysshe / be so yonge that neue of them may be kyng wherfore I coū∣seyle you that ye forsake your habyte & come with me / and I shall make suche a meane vnto the Brytons that ye shall be made kynge of this londe.
13313,¶ Of Constance that was kynge Con∣stantynes sone / whiche was a monke at Wynchestre / and how he was made kynge after his faders dethe / through counseyle of oger that was e of Westser for as moche as Aurilambros and his two bretherne were but yonge of age.
13314,And Vortiger let shee ya for to be kynge hymselfe.
13315,THis Vortiger coūseyled this Cō∣sāce so moche tyll he forsoke his abot and went with hym.
13316,And anone after he was crowned kyng by ye assent of the Brytons.
13317,This kynge Constance whan he was crowned & made kynge he wyll ne knewe but lytell of ye worlde nor coude no thynge what knyghthode axed.
13318,And he made Vortyger his chefe mayster & coūseyler / & gaue hym all his power for to ordeyn & to do as moche as to ye realme aperteyned.
13319,So yt hymselfe no thynge entermedled / but onely bare the name of kyng.
13320,Whā Vortiger sawe that he had all ye lōde in his warde & go∣uernaūce at his owne wyll / he thought by preuy treason to slee Cōstance ye kyng that he myght hȳselfe be crowned & ma¦de kyng & regne / & let sende after an hon¦dred knyghtes of Pehytes / ye worthyest of all ye londe / & them helde wt hym for to dwell / as to be kepers of his body / as he wolde go through the londe to ordeyne thynges yt appertayned to a kyng.
13321,And this Vortiger honoured so moche ye hon¦dred knyghtes & so moche gaue them of golde & syluer & of ryche iewelles / robes horses & other thȳges plente / wherfore they helde hym more lord than they dyd the kyng.
13322,And Vortiger told them: yf he myght be kyng / ye as it were through treason / he wold make them rychest of ye londe.
13323,So at ye last through grete gyftes that he had gyuen largely / they cryed through ye court yt Vortiger were better worthy to be kyng thā Cōstance.
13324,Wher∣fore Vortiger made semblaūt as he had ben wroth / & he departed thens from ye courte / and sayd he must go elles where for thinges that he had to do.
13325,And so the traytour sayd bycause yt they sholde slee kynge Constance.

13667,Kyng Vortiger through coūseyle of his brytons graūted hym a loue day.
13668,And it was ordeyned by the brytons yt the loue daye shold be holden besyde Salysbury on an hyll / & Engyst sholde come thyder with.

13695,And than ye messengers went thens & spedde so fast / that they came in to a town that was called Karmardyne / and as they passed forth theyr waye / they foūde two chyldren of .xxiiij.
13696,yere of age chydynge togyder with hasty wordes / and one of them sayd to that other.
13697,Donebat quod he / ye do all wronge to stryue with me / for ye haue no wytte ne no reason as I haue.
13698,Certes Merlyn quod he / of your wytte ne your reason I make no forte / for men tell comynly yt ye haue no thȳge of god almyghty / syth ye had neuer fa∣der / but euery man knoweth well who was your moder.
13699,¶ The messengers of kynge Vortiger whan they herde this stryfe bytwene ye two gromes / they as∣ked of them yt stode besyde them whens that Merlyn was borne / and also who nourysshed hym.
13700,And they tolde them yt a grete gentylwoman of Karmardyne called Adhan was his moder / but none knewe who was his fader.

13706,For I had no myght nor power to defende me from hȳ.
13707,And oftē he came to me in ye fore sayd maner / so yt he begate this chylde / but neuer myght I wyte what he was.
13708,¶ Of the answere of Merlyn vpon the kynges castell that wolde not stande.
13709,WHan Merlyn had herde all that his moder had sayd / he spake to the kynge in this maner.
13710,¶ Syr how I was begoten aske ye no more / for it falleth not to you nor to none other to knowe / but tell me ye cause wherfore I am brought to you / & wherfore ye haue sent for me.
13711,Certes quod the kynge / my wyse coūseylers haue done me to vnder∣stande / that ye morter of a werke that I haue begon behoueth to be tēpred with your blode / or the foūdament shall fayle for euermore.
13712,Syr said Merlin / wyll ye slee me for my blode to tempre with your morter.
13713,Ye quod the kynge / or elles shall neuer my castell stāde / as my coūseylers tell me.
13714,Than answered Merlyn to the kyng.
13715,Syr said he / let them come before me those wyse coūseylers / & I wyll pre∣ue that they saye not well ne truly.
13716,And whan the wyse men were comen / Mer∣lyn asked yf his blode were the cause to make ye werke stande & endure.
13717,All those wyse men were abasshed and coude not answere.
13718,Than sayd Merlyn to ye kyng Syr I shall tell you the cause wherfore your werke thus falleth & may not stan¦de.
13719,There is vnder the moūtayn where ye buylde your toure a grete pond of wa¦ter / & in the bottom of ye ponde vnder the water there is two dragons / that one is whyte & that other reed / that fyght to∣gyder agaynst your werke.
13720,Do ye depe myne tyll your men come to the pond / & do your men take away ye water all out & than ye shal se the dragons as I haue tolde you / yt fight togyder agaynst your werke.
13721,And this is the cause wherfore the foūdament falleth.
13722,The kyng anone let dygge vnder tyll ye men came to that ponde / & let do away all ye water / & there they foūde two dragons as Merlin had tolde them that egerly fught togyder.

13820,And for that cause he was called euer after Vter pendragon.

13830,The kynge anone sent after hym that he sholde come agayn & go not thens in despyte of hȳ.
13831,And ye erle wolde not come agayne in no maner of wyse.
13832,Wherfore the kynge was full wroth / & in wrath hym defyed as his deedly cu∣my.
13833,And ye erle went thens in to Corne∣wayle with his wyfe in to the castell of Tyntagell.
13834,And the kynge let ordeyne a grete hoost & came in to Cornewayle for to destroye the erle yf he myght.
13835,But he had put hym in y• stronge castell of Tyn tagell yt was well arayed / & wolde not yelde hym to ye kyng.

13845,And whan Merlin had so done he sayd to the kynge.
13846,Syr sayd he / now may ye go sodeynly to ye castell of Tyn∣tagell / & aske entre there and haue your wyll.
13847,The kyng toke pryuely all ye hoost to gouerne and lede to a knyght that he moche loued / & toke his waye towarde the castell / & with hym toke Vlfyn his chamberlayne and Merlyn.

13850,And on the morowe ye kyng toke his leue of ye lady and went agayn to his hoost.

13852,And the erle & his men manly defended them.
13853,But at the last it befel so that in the same assaute the erle hȳselfe was slayne & the castell taken.
13854,And the kyng anone returned agayn to Tynta∣gell and spoused Igreyne with moche honour and made her quene.

13862,ANd for as moche as kyng Vter was seke & myght not helpe hȳ selfe / he ordeyned Aloth sone of Eleyne that than was chosen for to be wardeyn and heftayne of all his folke.
13863,And so he anone & his Brytons assembled a grete hoost / & gaue batayle to Otta and to his folke / but Otta at the last was discom∣fyted.

13879,And this Cole∣grin was discōfyted & fledde vnto yorke & toke the cite / & there helde hym.
13880,And ye kynge besyeged hym there / but he gate no thynge / it was so stronge / & y• cite de∣fended it manly.
13881,In y• meane tyme Cole grin left y• cyte to Bladud & fled hymself to Cheldrik that was kyng of Almayne for to haue socour of hym.
13882,And he assem¦bled a grete power & arryued in scotlond with .v .C.

14190,Whan y• brytons sawe that / they hyed them out & fought / but anone they were slayne & discomfyted / & whyle the batayle duted the kynge all in despayre pryuely went in to wales / so y• men wist not where he became.
14191,And so was the towne of Chi∣chestre takē & destroyed.
14192,And after Gur∣mond went & destroyed townes & citees that neuer after were made again / as it is seen yet in this lōde in many places.
14193,¶How this londe was called Englōde for the name of Engist / and how many kynges were made after in this londe.
14194,WHan Gurmond had destroyed all the londe through out / he gaue y• londe to the saxons / & anone they toke it with good wyll.
14195,For y• saxons longe ty∣me had desyred it / for as moche as they were of Engistes kynrede / that first had all y• londe of Brytayn / & let them be cal∣led englyshmen / for bycause of Engistes name.
14196,And y• londe they let call Englond in theyr language / & the folke ben called Englyshmen / for as moche as in his ty∣me it was called Engist londe whan he had cōquered it of Vortiger.
14197,But fro the tyme y• Brute came fyrst in to this londe it was called Britayn / & y• folke brytons But syth y• tyme y• Gurmond conquered this londe y• saxons named it Englonde as before is sayd.
14198,And whan this was done / Gurmōd passed ouer in to fraūce & there cōquered many lōdes / & destroyed all chrysten people where as he came.
14199,And the saxons dwelled in this londe / & began fast to enhabyte it at theyr owne wyll / & they wold haue made newe kyn ges & lordes / but they coude neuer assent to haue onely one kyng for to be to them attendaūt / & therfore they made many kynges in dyuers shyres / as it was in Engistes tyme.
14200,The fyrst kyngdō was Kent / & that other Southsex / & y• thyrde westsex / the fourth Estsex / and the fyfth Northumberlōde / the syxth Estangle / y• is to saye Norfolk & Suffolk / & the .vij.
14201,Merchenrich / & that is ȳ erledom of Ni choll / Huntyngdon / Harford / Gloestre / wynchestre / warwyk & Derby / & so de∣parted all Englōd in to .vij.
14202,And after that it befell y• tho kynges warred oftē tymes togyder.
14203,And euer he y• was strongest toke hym y• was feblest / & so it was longe tyme that they had no kyng crowned amonge them / nor no chrysten man was than amonge them ne christē dom neyther.
14204,But were paynyms tyll y• saynt Gregory was pope of Rome / that had seen children of y• nacion of Englōde in y• cite of Rome y• were wonders fayre creatures / & had grete wyll & desyre to beholde them / & asked of y• marchaūtes of whens they were & of what nacyon.
14205,And men tolde hym they were of Eng∣londe / & englysshe they were called / but they & all y• people of englond were pay∣nyms / & byleued not on god.
14206,Alas sayd saynt Gregory / well may they be called englysshe / for they haue y• visages of aū gels / and therfore well ought they to be christen.
14207,And for this cause saynt Grego ry sent saynt Austin in to englonde / & .xl.
14208,good men wt hym that were of good lyfe & holy men to preche & teche / & to cōuerte the englysshe people / & turne thē to god / & y• was in the .vj.
14209,yere y• saynt Gregory had ben pope of Rome / y• is to saye / after the incarnacyon of our lord Iesu Chryst v .C .lxxxv.
14210,yere as y• cronycles telleth.
14211,¶How saynt Austyn baptysed & cōuer∣ted kyng Adelbryght / and the bysshops that he made his felawes.
14212,WHan saynt Austin came fyrst in to englonde / he arryued in the yle of Tenet / & so passed forth & came to Caun terbury / and there soiourned.
14213,And kyng Adelbryght of Kent y• was of y• lignage of Engist goodly receyued saynt Austyn & his felawes wt moche honour / & foūde them all y• them neded.
14214,And more ouer he gaue them a fayre place / y• now is cal led the abbey of saynt Austin / in whiche place helyeth hymself shryned.
14215,¶ This kynge Adelbryght was a good man / & with good wyll herd saynt Austyns pre dicacyons / and gaue hym leue to preche through out al his lōde of Kent to turne and cōuerte to hym all y• people that he myght.
14216,It befell so afterward through goddes grace / y• in a lytell tyme y• kynge hymselfe was cōuerted to god / & all the people of his londe was baptysed.
14217,And in y• meane whyle y• people turned them to god / saynt Austyn came to Rochestre & there preched the worde of god / & the paynyms scorned hym therfore / & cast vpon hym reygh tayles / so that all his mantell was hanged full of those reygn tayles / & for more despite they cast on hȳ the guttes of reyghes and other fysshe.
14218,Wherfore y• good mā saynt Austin was sore anoyed & greued / & prayed to god y• all those children of y• cite that sholde be borne afterward / y• is to saye / in the cite of Rochestre myght haue tayles / and so they had.
14219,Whan the kyng herde of this vengeaūce y• was fallen through saynt Austins prayer / he let make a hous in y• honour of almyghty god / wherin wo∣men shold be delyuered of theyr children at the brydges ende / in the which bous yet women of the cite ben delyuered of chylde.
14220,Whan saynt Gregory had herde tell how the englysshe people were tur∣ned to god & cōuerted / he sent vnto saynt Austyn his pallyon by a bysshop y• was called Paulyn / and made hym prymate and archebysshop of Englonde and sent worde that he sholde ordeyne and make bysshoppes in the londe.
14221,And anone as saynt Austyn had the pallyon of the di∣gnite of the archebysshop / he made two bysshoppes of his felawes the whiche came with hym from Rome / of whome that one was called Mellyte / & he helde his dignite at London / and that other was called Iustyne / and he helde his dignite at Rochestre.
14222,And this bysshop Mellyte than went to preche the worde of god in Essex / and there baptysed the kynge of y• countree whiche was called Sicwith y• was kyng Adelbryghtes to syn his systers sone.
14223,This Iustyn went to preche in Southsex / & turned moche of the people to god / & saynt Austin him selfe preched through out all Englonde.
14224,¶How saynt Austyn went in to wales where as the Brytons were / and how they wolde not be obedyent to the arche bysshop of Caunterbury.
14225,WHan all Englōde was baptysed and turned to god / saynt Austin went in to y• londe where as the brytons were to kepe them frō englyssh men / that is to saye in wales / & there he foūde monkes & abbeys / & .vij.
14226,bisshops For the brytons destroyed alway y• chry sten people y• saynt Austyn had cōuerted And he sayd to the bisshops that he was a legate of Rome / & prymate of all Eng∣londe / & that they sholde by all reason to hym be obedyent.
14227,And they sayd y• they wolde not / but to y• archebysshop of Car lyon they wolde / they wold neuer for no maner thinge be obedyent to y• englyssh men.
14228,For they sayd / englysshmen be our aduersaryes / and haue dryuen vs out of our coūtree / & we ben chrysten men and euer haue ben / & the englysshmen haue euer bē paynyms / saue now of late that they be cōuerted.
14229,Saynt Austyn might of them haue none other answere / but sayd pertly that they wolde neuer meke them to hym ne to the pope of Rome.
14230,Wherfore saynt Austin returned agayn to king Adelbryght y• was king of Kent & tolde him y• his folke wold not be to no man obedyent / but to y• archebysshop of Carlyon.
14231,Whan the king herde this / he was sore anoyed / & sayd that he wolde destroye them / & sent to Elfryde kyng of Northumberlonde y• was his frende / y• he shold come to hym wt all y• power that he myght / & he wold mete hym at Ley∣cestre / and fro thens they wolde go in to wales / & there destroye y• archebysshop of Carlyon / and all those that had refu∣sed saynt Austyn.
14232,¶How kyng Adelbryght & kyng Elfry de slewe Brecynall y• was a kyng of bry tons that helde y• coūtree of Leycestre.
14233,IT befell so that there was a kyng of brytons that helde the coūtre of Leycestre / & all the countre aboute / his name was Brecynall.
14234,And this bryton herde tell y• those two englysshe kynges wolde mete there at Leycestre for to go in to wales / he let ordeyne all the power that he had for to go fyght wt these two kȳges / but lytel it auayled hym / for his folke were all slayne / & hymself fledde / & lost his londes for euermore.
14235,And these two kȳges Adelbryght & Elfryde dwel led a whyle at Leycestre / & departed the londe amonge them / and toke homage & feaute of the folke of y• coūtree.
14236,And af ter they went toward wales.
14237,And they of wales herde tell of y• discōfyture that Brecmal had at Leycestre / & were won ders sore adrad of those two kynges / & toke & chose amōge them good men & ho ly / of heremytes / mōkes & preestes / & of other people grete plente / y• wente bare fote and wolwarde for to haue mercy of those two kynges.
14238,But y• kynges were so sterne & so wycked y• they wold neuer speke wt them / but slewe them all.
14239,Alas for sorowe / for they ne spared them no more than the wolfe doth the shepe / but smote of theyr hedes euerichone.
14240,And so they were all martyred y• to them came that is to vnderstande .v .C.
14241,And after they wente fro thens to Bangore for to slee all those y• they myght fynde there of y• brytons.
14242,And whan y• britons herde that / they assembled & ordeyned all theyr power for to fyght with them.

14244,And king Elfryd fled in to Northumberlond y• was his owne lōde And after the people of Leycestreshyre made wt strength Cadewan y• was Bre∣cinals sone kyng of Leycestre / & he after regned nobly / & with grete honour.
14245,¶How Cadewan kynge of Leycestre & Elfryde king of Northumberlond were frendes.
14246,And of the debate y• after was bytwene Edwyn and Cadwalyn that were bothe theyr sones.
14247,AFter that this bataile was done the britons assembled them and went thens & came to Leicestre / & made there Cadewan y• was Brynals sone kyng of Leycestre & of all y• coūtree.
14248,And he toke homage & feaute of all y• folke of the coūtree.
14249,And after that he assembled a grete hoost / and sayd he wolde go in to Northumberlonde to destroye kyng El∣fryde & slec hym yf he myght.
14250,And whā he was comen thyder / frendes went so bytwene them that they accorded them in this maner.
14251,That Elfryde shold hold all y• londe from Humber vnto scotlonde and Cadewan sholde haue all y• londe on this syde Humber to y• south.
14252,And after that they were good frendes all theyr lyf / & loued togyder as they had ben bre therne.
14253,And this Elfryde had a sone cal∣led Edwyn y• helde all y• ond of North∣berlonde after his faders deth as his fa der had hold al his lyfe tyme.
14254,And Cade wan had another sone called Cadwa that helde his faders londe as he whā he was alyue / & these loued as bre therne / & the loue insted bytwene them but onely two yere / & after began debate bytwene them thrugh an euyl enuyous cosyn of Cadwalyns called Bryens / so y• they assembled a grete host on bothe par tyes.
14255,And at y• last it befell y• Cadwalyn was discōfyted / & Edwyn pursued him and droue hym frō place to place / so y• at the lasthe fled in to Irlōde.
14256,And Edwyn destroyed his londe / & cast downe castels & brent his maners / & departed all Cad walyns londe among his frendes.
14257,And lōge tyme after came Cadwalyn agayn from Irlonde with a stronge power / & in playne batayle slewe Edwyn and all his frendes / & namely them that with∣helde his londes by Edwyns gyfte.
14258,¶How kynge Oswalde was slayne by kynge Cadwalyn & Peanda.
14259,And how Oswy that was saynt Oswaldes bro∣der regned after hym / & slewe Peanda.
14260,WHan Edwyn was slayne Offris his sone vndertoke the warre a∣gaynst Cadwalin his vncle / so that this Offris dyed duryng y• warre.
14261,And after the deth of Offris regned a gentyl chry∣sten man that moche lōued god almygh ty / that had all y• londe of Northumber∣londe by herytage y• was called Oald & he was kyng of all y• londe.

14263,This Cadwalyn warred vpon him and droue hym towarde scotlonde.
14264,And whan Cadwalyn sawe that he wold not abyde / he wolde no longer pursue hym / but toke some of his folk to Peanda his broder in lawe / & prayed hym to pursue after Oswald tyll that he were taken or slayne.
14265,And Cadwalyn returned home agayn.
14266,Whan Oswald herd y• ydȳges that Cadwalin turned home agayn / he wolde no longer flee / but abode Peanda & gaue hym batayle / & Peanda was dis comfyted & fled & came agayn to Cadwa lyn / & sayd y• wolde neuer holde a fote of londe of hym / but yf so were y• he wolde auenge hym on Oswald.
14267,Cadwalyn let assemble a grete hoost for to fyght with Oswald / so that he and Peanda came to Northumberlonde & gaue batayle vnto Oswald / & in y• same batayle was Os∣wald slayne & his heed smyttenof / & af∣ter he was buryed in y• abbey of Barde∣ney / in whiche place god hath wrought for hym many a fayre myracle / bothe there and els where.
14268,And anone Oswy his broder seased all the londe in to his handes y• was this Oswaldes.
14269,And the folke of Northūberlond loued hym won ders well / & helde hym for theyr lorde: But he had men of his kynne worthy ynough y• wolde haue departed y• londe & they warred lōge togyder.
14270,And for as moche as they were not strōge ynough they came to Pcanda & prayed hym of helpe & socour / & pmysed hym of y• londe largely vpon this couenaūt / y• he wolde gouerne them & helpe & coūseyle.

14272,And Oswy was a mekeman & moche loued peas & charite / & prayed Peanda of loue & peas / & profred hym of golde & syluer grete plente.
14273,And this Peanda was so proude y• he wolde not graūte hym peas for no maner thynge / but for all thynge he wolde fyght with hym.
14274,So at y• last there was set a day of batayle / & Oswy euer had trust vpon god / & Peanda tru∣sted to moche vpon his pryde and vpon his hoost that he had / and togyder they smote egerly.
14275,But Peanda was anone discomfyted & flayne.
14276,And this was af∣ter the incarnacion of our sauyour esu Chryst.
14277,And this Os∣wy regned .xxviij.

14280,AFter y• deth of Cadwalin regned his sone Cadwaldre well & no∣bly / & his moder was y• sister of Peanda And whā he had regned .xij.
14281,yere he fell in to a grete sekenes / & than was there a grete discorde bytwene the lordes of y• londe / that eche warred vpō other.
14282,And yet in that tyme there fell so grete derth and scarcete of corne & other vytayles in this londe y• a man myght go .iij.
14283,dayes fro towne to towne that he sholde not fynde to bye for golde ne syluer breed wyne / ne none other vytayle / wherwt a man myght lyue.
14284,But onely the people lyued by rotes of herbes / for other ly∣uynge had they none / so moche was it fayled all about / fysshes / wylde beestes & all other thynge / so y• yet to this mys∣auenture there fell so grete mortalyte & pestilence amonge the people by the cor∣rupcyon of y• deed bodyes.
14285,For they dyed so sodeinly / both grete & small lorde & seruaūt in etynge / goynge & spe kyng / they fell downe & dyed / so y• neuer was herde of more sodeyn deth amonge the people.
14286,For he y• went for to bury the deed body / with y• same deed body was buryed.
14287,And so they y• myght flee fledde & forsoke theyr londes & houses / as well for the grete hunger / derth / & scarcete of corne & other vytayle / as for y• grete mor talite & pestylence in the londe / & went in to other londes for to saue theyrlyues / & lefte y• londe all deserte & wasted / so that there was no man for to trauayle & tyll the loude / so that y• loude was aayne of corne & all other fruytes for define of tillers / & this misauēture duted .xj.
14288,yere & more / y• no man myght ere ne sowe.
14289,¶ How Cadwaldre went out of this londe in to lytell Brytayne.
14290,CAdwaldre sawe grete hunger / mortalite & pestilence / & the londe all poore / & faylynge cornes & other vy∣tayles / & his folke perisshed / & sawe also the moost party of his lond all wasted & voyde of people / he apparayled hȳ & his folke y• were lefte alyue / & passed ouer in to lytel Brytayn with a lytel nauy vnto kyng Aleyn y• he moche loued that was his cosyn / & that his fader had moche loued in his tyme.
14291,And as they sayled in the see he made moche lamētacyon / & so dyd all those that were with hym / and sayd.
14292,Dedisti nos dite tan{quam} oues estarū et in gentibus dispersisti nos.
14293,¶ And than began Cadwaldre to com∣playne hym to his tolke pyteously / and sayd.
14294,Alas sayd he / to vs wretches and caytyues is sorowe for our grete synnes of the whiche we wolde not amende vs whyle we had space / & now repentaūce is comen vpon vs through mysauēture whiche chaceth vs out of our owne re∣alme & propre soyle / out of the whiche somtyme Romayns / Scottes / Saxons nor Danes myght not exple vs.
14295,But what auayleth it now to vs that before tyme dyuers tymes haue goten many other londes / syth it is not y• wyll of god that we abyde & dwell in our owne lode God that is very iudge that all thinges knoweth before they be done or made / he seeth that we wolde not cese of our syn∣nes / & that our enemyes myght not vs nor our lygnage exyle fro and out of our realme / he wolde that we amended vs of our folyes / and that we sholde se our propre defautes / & therfore hath shewed to vs wrathe / & wyll chastyse vs of our misdedes / syth that he doth vs without batayle or strengthe of our enemyes by grete cōpanyes wretchedly to leue our realme & propre londe.
14296,Turne agayn ye Romayns / turne agayne ye Scottes / turne agayne ye Saxons / turne agayn ye frensshmen / now sheweth to you Bri¦tayn all deserte / the whiche your power myght neuer make deserte / ne yet your power hath not put vs now in exde / but onely the power of the kyng almyghty whome we haue oft offended by our fo∣lyes / the whiche we wolde not leue vn∣tyll he chastised vs by his diuyne power Amonge the wordes & lament acyons y• kyng Calwaldre made to his folke they arryued in lytel Gritayn & came to king Aleyn.
14297,And y• kyng receyued hym with grete ioye / & made him to be serued won ders nobly / and there he dwelled longe tyme after.
14298,The englysshe people that were lefte alyue & were escaped y• grete hunger & mortalite lyued in y• best wyfe that they might: & moche people sprang and came of them.
14299,And they sente in to saxonie where they were borne to theyr frendes for men / women / and chyldren to restore the citees with people and the townes that were all boyde of people / & for to labour / trauayle and tyll the eth.
14300,Whan the Saxons had herde these ty∣dynges / they came in to this londe won ders thycke in grete cōpanyes / & lodged themselfe in the coūtree all about where that they wolde / for they foūde no man to with stande them ne lette.
14301,And so they wexed & multyplyed gretly / & vsed the customes of y• coūtre wherof they were comen / and the lawes & the language of theyr owne londe.
14302,And they chaunged y• names of citees / townes / castelles / and boutghes / and gaue them names / and called them as they now be called.
14303,And they helde the coūtets / the batonages / and the lordshyppes & countrees in ma∣ner as y• Brytons before ryme had com∣passed them.
14304,And amonge other grete companyes that came from Germayn in to this londe came y• noble quene that was called Sexburga with men & wo∣men without nombre / & arryued in the coūtree of Northumberlonde / & toke the lond from Albion vnto Cornewayle / for her & for her folke.
14305,For there was none that myght them let / for all was deso∣late & voyde of people / but it were a fewe poore Brytons that were lefte on moū∣taynes & wodes vutyll that tyme.
14306,And fro that tyme forth lost the Britons this realme for all theyr dayes / and the Eng¦lysshe people began to regne / & departed the londe bytwene them / and they made many kynges aboute by dyuers partes of the londe as here ben deuysed.
14307,The fyrst of Westsex / the seconde Merchen∣rych / the thyrde Estangle / the fourthe kent / & the fyfthe Southsex.
14308,All those regned in this londe after that Cadwal∣dre was passed out of this londe & dwel∣led in lytell Brytayn with kynge Aleyn his cosyn and true frende.
14309,And whan he had longe dwelled there / and had know∣lege that the mortalite & pestylence was ouerpassed / & that the londe was reple∣nysshed with alyen people / he thought to come agayn in to this londe / & prayed kynge Aleyn his cosyn of socour & helpe that he myght be restored agayn to his owne propre realme & fyrst dignite.
14310,And kynge Aleyn graūted hym his askyng.
14311,Than dyd he apparayle hym to take his waye & vyage in to this londe.
14312,And prayed god almyghty deuoutly that he wolde make to hym demonstracyon / yf his prayer in to this londe were to hym pleasaūt or not.
14313,For agaynst the wyll of god almyghty he wolde no thynge do.
14314,Whan he had thus deuoutly made his prayer / a voyce from heuen sayd to hym and badde hym leue that iourney away in to Englonde / and that he sholde go to the pope of Rome / for it was not y• wyll of almyghty god that y• Brycons sholde regne ony more in Brytayne / nor neuer recouer the lond vnto the tyme that the pphecy that Merlyn sayd before be ful∣fylled.
14315,And that shold neuer be vnto the tyme were comen that y• relykes of his body shall be brought fro Rome & trans∣lated in to Brytayne.
14316,And whan the re∣likes of other sayntes y• haue ben hydde for the persecucyon of the paynym folke shall be foūde and openly shewed / than shall they recouer theyr lōde agayn / the whiche they haue soo longe tyme loste through theyr deseruynge.
14317,Whan Cad∣waldre had herde this answere / he mer uayled gretly / & tolde it to kyng Aleyn.
14318,Thankynge Aleyn sent for the clergye of his londe / and made them to brynge the storyes & prophecyes that Merliu & Sybyll had sayd in theyr prophecyes.
14319,And whan he knewe that the prophecy that Festom had prophecied of the Egle and other prophecyes accorded to the di∣uyne answere y• Cadwaldre had herde∣he coūseyled hym & ryght faythfully de∣syred hym to leue his people & his nauy and submytte hym to the disposicyon of god / & do all that the aūgell had cōmaū∣ded hym.
14320,Than Cadwaldre called ynor his sone and yuory his cosyn that was his systers sone / & sayd to them.
14321,Take sayd he my folke & my nauy that is here all redy / and passe in to wales / and be ye lordes of Brytons y• no dyshonour come to them by interrupeyon of y• paynyms folke for defaute of lordes.
14322,And than he hymselfe lefte his realme of Brytayne & his folke for euermore / & toke his waye vnto the pope of Rome Sergius / the whiche worshypped hym moche / and so he was confessed / & toke penaunce for his synnes.

15270,And after came fysshers & toke y• bedy with theyr nettes by nyght / & bare hym to saynt Clemētes chirche / & there buryed hym.
15271,Thus auenged hym Har∣diknoght on his broder.
15272,Thus kyng Har diknoght was so large a gyuer of meet & drynke / that his tables were set euery daye thre tymes full with ryall metes & drynkes for his meyny & for them that came to his courte.
15273,And this kyng Har∣diknoght sent after Emme his moder & made her to come agayn / for his broder Harold hare fote had dryuen her out of y• lond through coūseyle of y• erle Godwyn that than was the gretest lorde in Eng∣londe nexte the kynge / & that had moost rule / bycause he had spoused the dough∣ter of kyng Knoght begoten on his fyrst wyfe.

15279,For euer more before / yf the englyshmen & the da nes happened to mete vpō a brydge / the englyshmen shold not be so hardy to me∣ne a fote / but stande styll tyll the danes were passed forth.
15280,And more ouer yf the englyshmen had not bowed down theyr heedes to do reuerence vnto the danes / they sholde haue ben beten & defouled / & suche despytes & vylany dyd the danes to our englysshmē / wherfore they were driuen out of y• londe after Hardiknogh∣tes deth.
15281,For they had no lorde y• myght mayntayne them.
15282,And in this maner a∣uoyded the danes Englonde / that they neuer came agayn.
15283,The erles & barons by theyr comyn assent & counseyle sente vnto Normādy for to seke those two bre∣therne Alured and Edwarde that were dwellynge wt the duke Rycharde y• was theyr vncle / in entent for to crowne Alu∣red the elder broder / & make hym kyng of Englonde / & of this thynge to make an ende.
15284,The erles & barons made theyr othe / but the erle Godwyn of Westsex falsly & traytoursly thought to slee these two bretherne anone as they shold come in to Englond / in entent to make Harold his sone kynge / the whiche sone he had begoten on his wyfe kyng Hardiknogh tes doughter y• was a dane.
15285,And so this Godwyn went pryuely to southhamton for to mete there with the two bretherne at theyr landynge.
15286,And thus it befell yt the messengers yt went in to Normandy foūde not but onely Alured that was y• eldest broder.

15288,The messen∣gers said to Aluted how y• the erles & ba rons of Englond sent for hȳ / & y• he shold boldly come in to Englōde & receyue the realme: for king Hardiknoght was deed & all the danes dryuen out of the londe.
15289,¶ How Godwyn the fals traytour toke Alured vpon Gildesdown whan that he came from Normandye to be kynge of Englonde / & how he caused hym to be martyred in the yle of Ely.
15290,WHan Alured herd these tydȳges he thāked god / & toke shyppyng with all y• haste that he myght and passed the see and arryued at south hamton there Godwyn y• fals traytour was.
15291,And whan this traytour sawe y• he was comen / he welcomed hym & re∣ceyued hym with moche ioye / & sayd yt he wold lede hym to London where as all the barons of Englonde hym abode to make hym theyr kynge.
15292,And so they went on theyr waye towarde London.

15295,Now had the tray tour cōmaūded all his men that were wt hym / that whan they were comen vpon Gyldesdown that they shold slee all that were in Aluredes company / that came with hym from Normādy / & after that take Alured & lede hym in to y• yle of Ely and after put out bothe his eyen of his heed / & afterward brynge hym to deth.
15296,And so they dyd / for they slewe all y• com¦pany that were there / the nombre of.
15297,xij gentylmen y• were comen with Alured frō Normandy / & after they toke Alured & in the yle of Ely they put out his eyen & rent his wombe / & toke y• chefe of his bowels / & put a stake in to the groūde / & an ende of the bowels fastened therto / & with nedyls of yren they pricked y• good thylde / & so made hym to go aboute the stake tyll yt all his bowels were drawen out of his body / & so dyed Alured there through treason of the erle Godwyne.
15298,Whan the lordes of Englond had herde and wyst how Alured that sholde haue ben theyr king was put to deth through the fals traytour Godwyne / they were wonders wroth / & swore bytwene them god & his holy name / that he sholde dye a worse deth thā dyd Edryth of stration y• had betrayed his lorde Edmund Iren syde / & they wold haue put hym to deth but the traytour fledde thens in to Den¦marke / & there helde hym .iiij.
15299,yere and more / & lost all his londe in Englonde.
15300,SIluester the thyrde was pope af¦ter Benedictus.
15301,This Siluester was chosen / & Benedict was expulsed.

15863,But they answered yt they wold not put out one worde.
15864,Than sent the kyng to ye archebysshop by the foure bisshops yt he shold come to Caūterbury for to speke wt hym there / & sent to hym safeconduyt vnder pledges / y• is to saye his iustices Gilbert Poiteuin / William de la Brener / & Iohn fitz Hugh / that in theyr cōduyt safely he sholde come / & go agayn at his own wyll.

15866,Whan the archebysshop was comen / the kyng came to Chilham for he wolde come no nere Caūterbury at y• tyme.
15867,But he sent by his tresourer bysshop of Wynchestre that he sholde do out of the endentures the clause of resti∣tucyon for to make of ye goodes.
15868,And the archebysshop made his othe y• he wolde not do out one worde therof / ne yet chaū ge of that the bysshops had spoken & or∣deyned.
15869,And than ye archebysshop went agayn to Rome wtout ony more doynge.
15870,¶ Kyng Iohn was than more angryer than euer he was before / and let make a comyn crye through out all Englonde that all those yt had holy chirches rentes & went ouer ye see / that they sholde come agayn in to Englonde at a certayn daye or els they sholde lese all theyr rentes for euer more / & that he cōmaūded to euery sheryue through out all Englonde / that they sholde enquyre yf ony bysshop / ab∣bot / pryour / or ony other prelate of holy chirche / from that daye afterwarde re∣ceyue ony cōmaundement that cometh fro the pope / that they sholde take ye bo∣dy and brynge it before hym / and that they sholde take in the kynges handes all theyr lōdes of holy chirche that were gyuen to ony man by the archebysshop Stephen or by ye pryour of Caūterbury from ye tyme of ye eleccyon of ye archebys∣shop.

15876,M. marke of syluer.
15877,And they answered & sayd yt they durst no thynge do wtout theyr chefe ab∣bot of Cisteaux.
15878,Wherfore kynge John whan he came agayn from Irlond dyd them so moche sorow & care yt they wyst not where to abyde / for he toke so moche raūsom of euery hous of them / that the somme amoūted to .ix.
15879,marke / so that they were clene lost & destroyed / and voyded theyr houses & theyr londes through out all Englonde.
15880,And ye abbot of Wauersay drad so moche his menace that he forsoke ye abbey & went thens / & pryuely ordeyned hym ouer ye see to the hous of Cisteaux.
15881,Whan the tydynges came to the pope that ye kynge had done so moche malyce / than was he towarde the kyng full wroth / & sent two legates vnto ye kynge / that one was called Pan∣dulf / & that other Durant / yt they sholde warne the kynge in y• popes name / that he sholde cesse of his persecucyon that he dyd vnto holy chirche / and amende the wronge & the trespace that he had done to the archebysshop of Caūterbury / & to the pryour & to the monkes of Caunter∣bury / and to all the clergy of Englonde / and that he sholde restore all the goodes agayne yt he had taken of them agaynst theyr wyll / or els they sholde curse hym by name.

15886,And syr yet more ouer / that ye shall make restyō vnto all holy chirche / wherof they shall holde them well apayed.
15887,Than answe∣red the kynge as touchynge y• pryour & his mōkes of Caūterbury / all y• ye haue sayd I wyll do gladly / & all thynge that ye wyll ordeyne.

15891,And neuerthelesse in Eng∣londe as archebysshop yf he abyde / he shall neuer haue so good safecōdute but that he shall be taken.
15892,Than sayd Pan∣dulf vnto the kynge.
15893,Syr holy chirche was neuer wont to discharge an arche∣bysshop without cause reasonable.
15894,But euer it hath be wont to chastyse pryn∣ces that to god and holy chirche were inobedyent.

15907,And we assoyle all them also by the auctorite of the pope / and cōmaunde them also with you to fyght as wt hym that is enemy to all holy chirche.
15908,Than answered the kynge / what may ye do more to me.
15909,Than answered Pandulf / we saye to you in the worde of god / that ye nor none heyre that ye haue / neuer af¦ter this day may be crowned.
15910,Thā sayd the kynge / by hym that is almyghty & I had wyst this afore or that ye came in to my londe that ye had brought me su∣che tydynges / I sholde haue made you tyde all one yere.
15911,Than sayd Pandulf / full well wende we at our fyrst comyng that ye wolde haue ben obedyent to god & holy chirche / & haue fulfylled ye popes cōmaūdement / & now we haue shewed vnto you & pronounced the popes wyll as we were charged therwith.

15913,But for to suffre what deth ye coude ordeyn / we shal not spare for to tell you holly all y• popes message & his wyll / that we were charged with.
15914,¶ How Pandulf delyuered a clerke that had falsed and coūterfeyted the kynges money before the kynge hymselfe.
15915,ANd anone the kyng cōmaunded the sheriues & baylyes of North hamton that were in ye kynges presence that they sholde brynge forth all the pry¦soners / that they myght be done to deth before Pandulf / bycause ye kyng wende that they wolde haue gaynsayd theyr dedes for cause of dethe all thynge that he had spoken afore.
15916,Whan ye prysoners were comen before the kynge / the kyng cōmaunded some to be hanged / & some to be drawen / & some to drawe out theyr eyen of theyr heed.
15917,And amōge all other there was a clerke that had falsed the kynges money.
15918,And the kyng cōmaun∣ded that he sholde be hanged & drawen.
15919,And whan Pandulf herde this cōmaū∣dement of the kynge / he sterte hym vp ryght quyckly / and anone asked a boke and a candell / and wold haue cursed the kynge / and all them that wold set vpon the clerke ony hande.
15920,And Paudulf him self went for to seke a crosse.
15921,And ye kyng folowed hym / & delyuered hym ye clerke by ye hande / that he sholde do with hym what he wolde.
15922,And thus was ye clerke delyuered & went thens.
15923,And Pandulf and Durant his felowe went from the kynge / and came agayne to the pope of Rome / and tolde hym that kynge Iohn wolde not be amended / but euer abode so accursed.
15924,And neuerthelesse the pope grasited y• yere through out all Englōde that preestes myght synge masses in co uenable chirches / & cōsecrate our lordes body / & gyue it to seke mē whiche were lykely to passe out of this worlde / & also that men myght thrysten children ouer all ye londe.

15926,Whan these tydynges came to kyng Iohn / than was he sore anoyed & sore drad lest he sholde lese his realme / & hymselfe be done to deth.
15927,Than sent he to the pope messengers / & sayd he wold be iustyfyed / & come to amendmēt in all thynges / & wolde make satisfaccyon to all maner men after ye popes ordyuaūce Than sent ye pope agayn in to englonde Pandulf & other messengers / & came to Caūterbury to the kyng / & there abode.

15929,And all ye grete lor∣des of englonde sware vpon the boke & by the holydome / that yf ye kyng wolde not holde his othe / they wolde make hȳ by strength to holde it.
15930,Than the kynge put hym to ye courte of Rome & to ye pope & than gaue he vp ye realme of englonde & of Irlonde for him & for his heyres for euermore that shold come after hym / so that kyng Iohn & his heyres shold take those two realmes of the popes handes And sholde euery yere paye ferme vnto the courte of Rome a thousande marke of syluer.
15931,And than toke the kynge the crowne of his heed & set hȳ on his knees and these wordes he sayd in herynge of all the grete lordes of englonde.
15932,Here I resygne vp the crowne & the realme of englonde in to the handes of pope Inno cent the thyrde / & put me hooly in to his mercy & in his ordinaūce.
15933,Pandulf than receyued y• crowne of kyng Iohn / & kept it .v.
15934,dayes as for a seasynge takynge of two realmes of Englonde and Irlonde And confermed all maner thynges by his chartre that foloweth after.

15948,¶ How the clerkes that were outlawed of Englonde came agayn / & how kynge Iohn was assoyled.
15949,WHan this chartre was made & ensealed / the kynge receyued a∣gayne his crowne of Pandulfs hande / & sente anone vnto the archebys∣shop Stephen / & to all his other clerkes and lewd men that he had exyled out of this londe / that they sholde come agayn in to Englonde & haue agayn theyr lon∣des & also theyr rentes / & that he wolde make restytucyon of the goodes that he had taken of theyrs agaynst theyr wyll The kyng hymselfe than & Pandulf / & the erles & barons went to wynchestre agaynst y• archebysshop Stephen.

15953,And that was on saynt Margaretes daye.
15954,And the arche bysshop anone went for to synge masse.
15955,And y• kyng offred at the masse a marke of golde.
15956,And whan y• masse was done / all they went to receyue al theyr londes without ony maner gaynsayenge.
15957,And that daye they made all myrth and ioye ynough.
15958,But yet was not y• enterdytyn¦ge releaced / bycause y• pope had set that the enterdytynge sholde not be done tyll the kyng had made full restitucyon of y• goodes that he had take of holy chirche And y• hymselfe sholde do homage to the pope by a tertayne legate that he sholde sende into englonde.
15959,And thā toke Pan∣dulf his leue of y• kynge & the archebys∣shop / & went agayne to Rome.
15960,And the archebysshop anone let come before him prelates of holy chirche at Redynge for to treate & coūseyle how moche & what they sholde aske of y• kynge for to make restytucyon of y• goodes y• he had taken of them.
15961,And they ordeyned & sayd / that the kyng sholde gyue to y• archebysshop thre thousande marke for the wronge y• the kynge had done vnto hym.
15962,And also by porcions to other clerkes .xv.
15963,¶ And this same tyme Nicolas bys∣shop of Tuscan cardynall penytencer of Rome came in to Englonde through the popes cōmaūdement / the .v.

15965,nonas of October / for bycause that kyng Iohn & all the kynges y• came after hym shold euermore holde y• realme of Englonde & of Irlonde of god & of the pope / payenge to the pope by yere as is aboue sayd.
15966,¶ How y• enterdytynge was vndone in englonde / & of y• debate y• was bytwene kyng Iohn & the barons of the realme WHan kynge Iohn had done his homage to y• legate y• shewed hȳ the popes lettre y• he shold paye to Iulyan / and yelde agayne that was kynge Rychardes wyfe y• thyrde parte of the londe of Englonde & of Irlonde y• he had with holden syth that kyng Ry∣charde dyed.
15967,Whan kynge Iohn herde this / he was wonders wroth.
15968,For vtter¦ly y• enterditynge myght not be vndone tyll that he had made gree & resticucyon to the foresayd Iulyan of that she asked The legate than went agayn to y• pope after Chrystmasse.
15969,And the kynge than sent messengers outr see to Iulian that was kyng Rychard wyfe for to haue a relese of y• she axed of hym.
15970,¶ And so it befell y• Iulyan dyed anone after ster.
15971,And in so moche the kyng was quyte of that thynge that she asked.
15972,But than at the feest of saynt Iohn that came nexte after through the popes cōmaūdemēt y• enterdityng was fyrst released through out all Englonde the .vij.
15973,yere was the londe enterdited.
15974,And on the morow men ronge and sayd masse through out all London / & so after through out all Englonde.
15975,¶ And y• next yere after there began a grete debate by¦twene kyng Iohn & the lordes of Eng∣londe / for bycause he wolde not graunte the lawes and holde / the whiche saynt Edwarde had ordeyned / & had ben ved and holden vnto that tyme that he had them brokē.
15976,For he wolde holde no lawe but dyd all thynge that hym lyked and dysheryted many men without consent of lordes & peres of the londe.
15977,And wold dysheryte y• good erle Radulf of hestre for bycause that he vndertoke hȳ of his wyckednes / and for cause that he dyd so moche shame & vylany to god & to holy chirche.
15978,And also for he helde & haunred his owne broders wyfe / and lay also by maner other womē grete lordes dough∣ters / for he spared no woman that hym lyked for to haue.
15979,Wherfore all y• fordes of the londe were wroth / & toke the cyte of London.
15980,To cease this debate the ar∣chebysshop & lordes of the londe assem∣bled before the feest of saynt Iohn bap∣tyst in a medow besyde y• towne of Sta∣nes / that is called Romney mede.
15981,And the kynge made them there a chartre of fraunchyse / suche as they wolde aske / and in suche maner they were accorded And that accordement lasted not longe.
15982,For the kynge hymselfe soone after dyd agaynst the poynces of y• same chartre that he had made.
15983,Wherfore the moost part of the lordes of the londe assembled them / & began to warre vyon hȳ agayn and brent his townes & robbed his folke and dyd all thesorowe that they myght and made themselfe as stronge as they myght with all theyr power / & thought to dryue hym out of Englonde / & make Lowys y• kynges sone of Fraūce kynge of Englonde.
15984,And than kyng Iohn sent ouer see / and ordeyned so moche people or normans & of pyecardes and of flem∣mynges / soo that the londe myght not susteyne them but with moche sorowe.
15985,And amonge all this people there was a man of Normandye that was called Faukes of Brent / & this Norman & his cōpany spared neyther chirche ne hous of religyon but they brent and robbed it & bare awaye all that they myght take so that y• londe was all destroyed / what on one syde & what on another.
15986,The ba¦rons and lordes of Englonde ordeyned amonge them the best spekers and wy∣sest men / and sent them ouer the see vn∣to kynge Philyp of Fraūce / and prayed hym y• he wolde sende Lowys his sone in to Englonde to be kynge of Englonde and to receyue the crowne.
15987,¶ How Lowys y• kynges sone of fraūce came in to Englonde wt a stronge power of people to be kynge of Englonde.
15988,WHan kyng Philip of Fraūce herd these tydynges / he made certayn aliaunce bytwene them by theyr comyn eleccyon y• Lowys kynge Philyps sone of Fraūce shold go with them in to Eng londe and dryue out kynge Iohn of the londe.
15989,And all that were in the presence of Lowys made vnto him homage and became his men.
15990,And the barons of eng londe helde them styll at London / and abode Lowys y• kynges sone of fraūce.
15991,And this was the nexte batardaye br∣fore the Astention of our lorde y• Lowys came into Englonde with a stronge po∣wer.
15992,And that tyme kynge Iohn had taken all the castelles of Englonde in to alyens handes.

16624,But those that were within manly defended them / that the barons coude not gete the castell.
16625,And whan the kynge herde yt his castell was besyeged he swore by god & by his names / that ye syege sholde be remeued / & assembled an huge power of people and went thyder∣ward to rescowe the castell / & his power encreased from daye to daye.
16626,Whan the erle of Lancastre / & the erle of Herford / & the barons of theyr cōpany herde of this thynge / they assembled all theyr power & went to Burton vpon Trent & kepte ye brydge yt the kyng sholde not passe ouer.

16634,But the false traytour came not there no maner men for to warne ne reyse to helpe his lorde.
16635,And whan the fals traytour herde tell yt his lord was discōfited at Burton vpon Trent / as a fals traytour thefe stale a∣waye & robbed in Rauensdele his lordes men yt came from the discōfyture / & toke of them hors & harneys & all yt they had & slewe of them al that he myght take / & came & yelded hym to the kynge.
16636,Whan the good erle Thomas wyst yt he was so betrayed / he was sore abasshed / & sayd to hȳselfe.
16637,O almighty god how myght Robert Holand fynde in his herte me to betraye / syth I loued hym so moche.
16638,O god well may now a man se by hȳ / yt no man may deceyue an other rather than he that he trusteth moost vpon / he hath full euyll yelded me ye goodnes & ye wor∣shyp yt I haue done to hym / & through my kyndnes haue auaūced him & made hym hye where that he was lowe / and he maketh me go from hygh vnto lowe / but yet shall he dye an euyll deth.

16643,But whan the good erle Thomas herde this / he answered in this maner & sayd.
16644,Lordes said he / yf we go toward ye north the northeren men wyll saye that we go towarde the Scottes / and so we shall be holden traytours / for cause of distaūce yt is bytwene kyng Edward & Robert the Brus that made him kyng of Scotlond & therfore I saye as touchynge my selfe I wyll not go no ferther in to the north than to myn owne castell of Pountfret.

16652,Syr Andrewe sayd he / ye may well vnderstande how yt out lorde the kynge is ladde and mysgouer∣ned by moche false coūseye through syr Hugh Spenser the fader and syr Hugh his sone / & syr Iohn erle of Arundell / & through mayster Robert Baldok a false pylled clerke / that now is dwellyng in ye kynges courte.
16653,"Wherfore I praye you that ye wyll come with vs with all the power that ye haue ordeyned & helpe to destroye ye venym of Englonde, and the traytours that ben therin / and we wyll gyue vnto you all ye best parte of .v."
16654,∣domes that we haue & holde / & we wyll make vnto you an othe yt we wyll neuer do thynge without your counseyle / & so ye shall be eft as well wt vs as euer was Robert Holand.
16655,Than answered syr An∣drewe of Herkela & sayd.

16659,And so wente the fals traytour tyraūt and as a fals forsworne man.
16660,For through ye noble erle Thomas of Lancastre he receyued the armes of chyualry / & of hym was made knyght.
16661,Than myght men searchers drawe thē on that one syde & on yt other / & knightes also / & thā fought togyder wonders sore And also amonge all other syr Humfrey de Boughon erle of Herforde a worthy knyght of renome through all chrysten∣dom stode & fought with his enemyes vpon the brydge / & as ye noble lorde stode & fought vpon ye brydge / a thefe rybaud skulked vnder the brydge & fyersly with a spere smote the noble knyght in to the foūdament / so ye his bowelles fell about his feet.
16662,Alas for sorowe / for there was slayne the floure of solace & cōforte & also of curteysy.
16663,And syr Roger of Clifford a noble knyght stode euer & fought / & well & worthely hym defended / but at ye last he was sore wounded in his heed / & syr Willyam of Sllay & syr Roger of Ber∣nefelde were slayue at yt batayle.
16664,Whan syr Andrewe of Herkela sawe yt syr Tho∣mas men of Lancastre lessed & slaked / a∣none he & his company came vnto ye gen¦tyll ayght / & sayd vnto hym wt an hye voyce.
16665,Yelde the traitour yelde the.
16666,The gentyll erle Thomas than answered & sayd.
16667,Nay lordes / traitours be we none & to you we wyll vs neuer yelde whyle that our lyues lasteth / but rather wyll we dye our treuth than yelde vs vnto you.
16668,And syr Andrewe agayne behelde syr Thomas & his company yellynge & cryenge as a wood wolfe & sayd.
16669,Yelde you traytours taken yelde you / sayenge with an hye voyce / beware syrs yt none of you be so hardy vpon lyfe & ly e to miso Thomas body of Lancastre.
16670,And with that worde the good erle Thomas went into the chae and sayd kelyng vpon his knees / and turned his vysage towarde the crosse and sayd.
16671,Almyghty god vnto the I yelde me / & holly I put me vnto thy mercy.
16672,And with that the vylayns & rybaudes lepte aboute hym on euery syde as tyrauntes & wood tur∣mentours / and despoyled hym of his ar mure / and clothed hym in a robe of raye that was of his squyers lyuerey / & forth ladde hym vnto Yorke by water.
16673,Than myght men se moche sorowe & care.
16674,For the gentyll knyghtes fled on euery syde and ye rybaudes & vylayns egerly them descryed / and cryed on hygh / yelde you traytours yelde you.
16675,And whan they were yolden / they were robbed & boūde as theues.
16676,Alas the shame and despyte that ye gentyll ordre of knyghthode had there at that batayle.
16677,And the lond was than without lawe / for holy chirche had than no more reuerence thā yf it had ben a brodell hous.
16678,And in that batayle was the fader against the sone / and the vncle agaynst the neuewe.
16679,For so moche vn∣kyndnes there was neuer seen before in Englonde as was that tyme amonge folkes of one nacyon.
16680,"For one kynrede had no more yte on that other / than an hogry wolfe hath of a shepe, & it was no wonder."
16681,For the grete lordes of Eng∣londe were not all borne of o ayon / but were edled with other nas / that is for to saye / some were Brytons some Saos / some nes / some Pe∣hytes / some Fren / some Normās / Spanyades / Romayns / Henoers / Femges / with my other oyons the whiche nacyons aced not to the kynde blode of Englond.
16682,And yf so gret lordes ha bē onely dded o nglysshe people / than sholde rest and pes haue ben age them without oy eny.
16683,And at ye batayle were taken prysoners syr Roger Eord / syr Iohn Mbray syr Wyllyam Tuchit / syr Willyam itz Willyam / & many other worthy knygh tes there were takē at that batayle.
16684,And syr Hugh Dandell the nexte daye after was taken & put in to prison / and sholde haue bē done to deth yf he had not spou∣sed the kynges nece that was erle Gyl∣bertes syster of Glocestre.
16685,And anone af∣ter was syr Barthmew of Badelsmere taken at Stowe parke / a manoyr of the bysshop of Lyncolnes / that was his ne∣uewe / & many other barons & baronets wherfore was made moche sorowe.
16686,¶ How syr Thomas of Lancastre was byheded at Pountfret / and .v.
16687,barons & a knyght drawen & hanged there.
16688,NOw I shall tell you of the noble erle syr Thomas of Lancastre.
16689,Whan he was taken & brought to yorke many of the cyte were full glad / & vpon hym cryed with an hygh voyce.
16690,O syr traytour ye be welcome / blyssed be god / for now ye shall haue the rewarde that longe tyme ye haue deserued.
16691,And cast vpon hym many snowe balles / & many other reproues they dyd hym.
16692,But the gentyll erle suffred all and sayd not one worde agayne.
16693,And at ye same tyme the kynge herde of this discōfyture / & was full glad / and in haste came to Poūtfret and syr Hugh Spenser & syr Hugh his sone / & syr Iohn erle of Arundel / and syr Edmond of wodstok the kynges broder erle of Kent / syr Aymer of Valaūce erle of Penbroke / & mayster Robert Baldok a fals pylled clerke / that was preuy and dwelled in the kynges courte / & all came thyder with the kynge.
16694,And the kynge entred in to the castell.
16695,And syr Andrewe of Herkela a fals tyraūt through ye kyn∣ges cōmaundement toke with hym the gentyll erle Thomas to Pountfret / and there he was prysoned in his owne ca∣stell that he had newe made / that stode agaynst the abbey of kynge Edwarde.
16696,And syr Hugh Spenser the fader & his sone cast in theyr thoughtes how and in what maner the good erle Thomas of Lancastre shold be put to deth without ony iudgemēt of his peres.
16697,Wherfore it was ordeyned through ye kynges Iusti∣ces that the kynge shold put vpon hym poyntes of treason.
16698,And so it befell that he was ledde to barre before the kynges Iustices bare heded as a thefe in a fayre hall in his own castell where as he had made many a grete feest to riche & poore.
16699,And these were his Iustices syr Hugh Spenser the fader / & Aymer of aae erle of Penbroke / syr Edmōd of wodstok erle of Kent / syr Iohn of Brytayn erle of Rychmond / & syr Robert Malm Iustice / & this syr Robert him acouped in this maner.
16700,Thomas at the first our lorde ye kyng & this courte excludeth yu of all maner answere.
16701,Thomas our ld the kyng putteth vpon you yt ye haue his lōd ryden wt baner displayed against his peas as a traytour.
16702,And with that worde yt gentyll erle Thomas wt an voyce sayd.
16703,Nay lordes forsoth & by a Thomas I was neuer traytour.
16704,The Iustyce sayd agayn.
16705,Thomas our lord the kyng putteth vpō you yt ye haue rob¦bed his folke & murdred his people as a thefe.
16706,Thomas also ye kyng putteth you yt he discōfyted you & your people wt his folke in his owne realme wherfore ye went & ed to ye wode as an .
16707,And Thomas as a traitour ye ought to be hanged by reason but the kyng hath forgyuen you that Iudgement for ue of quene Isabell.
16708,And Thomas reason wolde that ye sholde be hanged but the kynge hath forgyuen you yt udgement for loue of your lygnage.
16709,But Thomas for as moche as ye were taken fleynge & as an oulawe ye kyng wyll yt your heed be smytten of as ye haue well deserued Anoue haue hym out of pres & brynge hym to his iudgement.
16710,Whan ye gentyll knyght Thomas had herd al these wor des / with an hye voyce he cryed sore we∣pyng & sayd.
16711,Alas saint Thomas fayre fader / alas shall I be deed thus.
16712,Graūt me now blissedfull god answere.
16713,But all auayled hym o thynge.
16714,For the cursed Gascoyns put hym hyder & thyder / & on hym cryed wt an hye voyce.
16715,O kyng Ar∣thur moost terryble and dredefull / well knowen is now thyn open traytory / an euyll deth shalt thou anone dye / as thou hast well deserued it.
16716,And than they set vpon his heed in scorne an olde chapelet that was all to rent that was not worth an halfpeny.
16717,And after that they set hȳ vpon a lne whyte palfrey full vnseme∣ly / & also all bare / & with an olde brydell and with an horryble noyse they droue hym out of the castell toward his deth / and they cast vpon hym many balles of snowe in despyte.
16718,And as the traytours ladde hym out of the castel he sayd these pyteous wordes / holdynge vp his han∣des towarde heuen.
16719,Now the kynge of heuen gyue vs mercy / for ye erthly kyng hath vs forsaken.
16720,And a frere prechour went with hym out of the castell tyll he came to the place that he ended his lyfe / vnto whom he shroue hȳ of all his lyfe.
16721,And the gentyll erle helde the frere won¦ders fast by the clothes & sayd to hym.
16722,Fayre fader abyde with vs tyll that I be deed / for my flesshe quaketh for drede of deth.
16723,And the sothe to saye / the gentyl erle set hym vpon his knees and turned hym towarde ye eest.
16724,But a rybaud that was called Higone of Moston set hande vpon the gentyl erle / & sayd in despyte of hym.
16725,Syr traytour turne the toward ye Scottes thy foule dethe to receyue / and turned hym toward the north.
16726,The no∣ble erle Thomas answered than with a mylde voyce & sayd.
16727,Now fayre lordes I shall do your wyll.
16728,And with ye worde the frere went from hym sore wepynge And anone a rybaud wente to hym and smote of his heed the .xi.
16729,of Apryll / in the yere of grace.
16730,Alas yt euer suche a gentyll blode sholde be put to deth wtout cause & reason.
16731,And traytoursly was the kynge counseyled whan he through the fals coūseyle of ye Spensers suffred syr Thomas his vn∣cles sone to be put to suche a deth & so by heded agaynst all reason.
16732,And grete pite it was also yt suche a noble kynge sholde be deceyued and mysgouerned through coūseyle of ye fals Spensers the whiche he maynteyned through loselry against his honour & also {pro}fyte.
16733,For afterwarde there fell grete vengeaūce in Englonde bycause of the foresayd Thomas dethe.
16734,¶ Whan the gentyll erle of his lyf was passed / the pryour & ye monkes of Poūt∣fret gate the body of syr Thomas of the kyng / and they buryed it before the hye awter on ye ryght syde.
16735,That same daye that this gētyl knyght was deed / there were hanged & drawen for ye same qua∣rell at Poūtfret / syr Wyllyam Tuchet / syr William fitz William / syr Warreyn of ysell / syr Henry of Bradborne / and syr Wyllyam Chayny / barons all / & Iohn Page squyer.
16736,And soone after at Yorke were drawen & hāged sir Roger Clifford syr Iohn of Mambray barōs / & syr Go∣selyn Dauyll knyght.
16737,And at Brystowe were drawen and hanged / syr Henry of wemyngton / and syr Henry Mounford barons.
16738,And at Glocestre were drawen and hanged syr Iohn Geffard / and syr Willyam of Elmebrugge barons.

16742,And at Caūterbury was drawen & hanged syr Barthylmewe Badelsmore / & syr Bar∣thylmewe of Asshebourneham barons / And at Cardyfe in Wales syr Willyam Flemmynge baron.
16743,¶ How kyng Edward went in to Scot∣londe with an hondred thousande men of armes / and myght not spede.
16744,ANd whā kyng Edward of Eng∣londe had brought the floure of chyualry vnto theyr deth through coun seyle & consent of syr Hugh Spenser the fader / and syr Hugh the sone / he became as wood as ony lyon.
16745,And what so euer the Spensers wolde haue / it was done / so well the kynge loued them that they myght do wt hym all thynge yt them ly∣ked / wherfore ye kyng gaue to syr Hugh Spenser the fader the erledom of Wyn∣chestre / & to syr Andrewe of Herkela the erledom of Cardoyll in preiudyce and in harmynge of his crowne.
16746,And kyng Ed¦ward than through coūseyle of ye Spen¦sers disheryted all them that had ben a∣gaynst hȳ in ony quarell wt Thomas of Lancastre / & many other were dishery∣ted also / bycause yt the Spensers couey∣ted to haue theyr lōdes / & so they had all that they wolde desyre with wronge & agaynst all reason.
16747,Than made ye kyng Robert Baldok a fals pylled clerke chaū celer of Englonde / through coūseyle of ye foresayd Spensers / & he was a fals ry∣baude and a couetous.
16748,And so they coū∣seyled the kyng moche that the kyng let take to his own warde all ye goodes of ye lordes yt were put wrongfully to deth in to his own hādes.
16749,And as well they toke the goodes yt were wtin holy chirche as ye goodes yt were wtout / & let them be put in to his tresoury in London / & let them call his forfeytes.
16750,And by theyr coūseyle the kyng wrought / for euermore he dis∣heryted them yt ought the goodes.
16751,And through theyr coūsele let arere a tallage of all ye goodes of Englond / wherfore he was ye richest kyg ye euer was in englōd after Willyam basard of Normany ye conquered Englonde.
16752,And yet through counseyle of them hy semed ye he had not ynough / but made yet euery towne of Englonde for to fynde a man of armes vpon theyr own costes / for to go & warre vpon the Scottes yt were his enemyes / wherfore ye kyng went in to scotlonde wt an .C.
16753,M. men of armes at whitsontyde in ye yere of our lord.
16754,But the scottes went & hyd them in wodes & in mountaynes & taryed ye englysshmen fro day to day / yt the kyng myght for no maner thȳge fynde them in playn wherfore many englisshmen ye had vytayles dyed there for honger wōders fast / & sodynly in goynge & comynge & namely those that had ben against Tho¦mas of Lācastre & robbed his men vpon his lōdes.
16755,Whan kyng Edward sawe yt vytayles fayled hym / he was wonders sore dyscōforted / bycause also yt his men dyed: & for he might not spede of his ene∣myes.
16756,So at ye last he came aga to Englōde.
16757,And anone after came Iames douglas & also Thomas huge hoost into Northumberlonde & wt them ye englysshmen yt were dryuen out of Englonde / & came & robbed ye & slewe the people & also brnt a owne that was called Northall & many other townes to Yorke.
16758,And whan the kyng herde these tydynges he let mn all maner of men that myght trauayle.
16759,And so the Englysshmen mette y• Scot∣tes at the abbey of eyghlonde the .xv.
16760,daye after Myghelmasse in y• sam yere aboue sayd and the Englysshmen were discomfyted.
16761,And at that dyscomfytu was taken syr Iohn of Brytayn erle of Rychemond that helde the coūtre and the erledome of Lancastre and after he payed an huge raunsom and was let go And after that he went in to Fraunce / & came neuer afterwarde agayne.
16762,¶ How syr Andrewe of Herkela was ta∣ken & put to deth y• was erle of Cardoyll.
16763,THan at y• tyme was syr Andrew of Herkela that newe was made erle of Cardoyll / bycause y• he had taken the good erle Thomas of Lancastre.
16764,He had ordeyned through y• kynges cōmaū demēt of Englonde for to brynge him all the power y• he myght for to helpe hȳ a∣gaynst y• Scottes at y• abbey of Beygh∣londe.
16765,And whan the fals traytour had gadred all y• people y• he myght & sholde haue comē to y• king to y• abbey of Beigh¦lond / the fals traytour ladde them by an other countree through Copelonde / and through y• erledom of Lancastre / & went through y• coūtree & robbed & slewe folke all y• he myght.
16766,And ferthermore y• fals traytour had taken a grete sōme of gold & syluer of syr Iames Douglas for to be agaynst y• kyng of Englond / & to be hel∣pyng & holdyng wt the scottes / through whose treason y• kyng of Englond was discomfyted at Beighlonde or y• he came thyder.
16767,Wherfore y• kynge was toward hym wonders wroth / & let pryuely en∣quyre by y• coūtre aboute how y• it was.
16768,And so men enquyred & espyed / that at y• last the trouth was foūde & sought / and he atteynt & taken as a fals traitour / as the good erle Thomas of Lācastre hym tolde / or that he was put to dethe at his takynge at Burbrydge / & to hym sayd / or that yere were done he shold be taken & holden a traytour.
16769,And so it was as y• holy man sayd.

16773,And our lorde y• kyng wyll that the ordre of knyghthode by the whiche y• receyued all thyne honour and worship vpon thy body / be all brought to nought & thyne estate vndone / y• other knightes of lower degree may after be ware / the whiche lord hath hugely auaunced the in dyuers coūtrees of Englonde / & that all may take ensample by y• / theyr lorde afterward truly for to serue.
16774,Than com¦maūded he a knaue anoue to hewe of his sporres on his heles.
16775,And after he lette breke the swerde ouer his heed / the whi¦che the kyng gaue hym for to kepe & de∣fende his londe therwith whan he had made hym erle of Cardoyl.
16776,And after he let hȳ be vnclothed of his furred tabard and of his hode / & of his furred cotes / & of his gyrdell.

16791,¶ And whan y• Spensers herd that god dyd suche myracles for this ho¦ly man / they wold not byleue it in no ma¦ner wyse / but said openly y• it was grete heresy suche vertue of hȳ to byleue.
16792,And whan syr Hugh Spenser the sone sawe all this doynge / anone he sente his mes∣senger from Poūtfret where as he dwe∣led to kyng Edward / that than was at Grauen at Scipton / bycause y• the kyng sholde vndo y• pylgrymage.
16793,And as y• ry baud messenger went to ward the kyng for to do his message / he came by the hyll where as the good martyr was done to deth / & in the same place he made his or∣dure / & whā he had done he rode toward the king / & a stronge flyxe came vpon hȳ or that he came to Yorke / & thā he shedde all his bowels at his foundament.
16794,And whan syr Hugh Spenser herde these ty dynges / somdele he was adradde / and thought for to vndo y• pilgrymage yf he myght by ony maner waye.

16797,Full well wend he to haue taken Chrystes myght & his power & the grete boos of myracles that he shewed for his martyr saȳt Thomas through all christendom.

16886,wekes / tyll that the quene Isabell sent her lettres to the comuners & prayed them that they wolde suffre & graūt / that the bysshop myght be taken out of ye place & be buryed at Excestre in his own chirche / & so he was / & his two squyers were buryed at saint Clemētes chirche wtout temple barre.
16887,And it was no wonder though that bysshop dyed an euyl deth / for he was a couetous man / & had wt hym no mercy / & euyll coūseylled the kynge.
16888,And soone after was Arnold of Spayne taken / that assented to haue ladde .v.

16891,And this Arnold was put to deth wtout the cite.
16892,¶ How kyng Edward & syr Hugh spen∣ser & the erle of Arundell were taken.
16893,WHan kynge Edwarde had sente mayster Walter Staplton his tresourer to London / for to kepe the cite vnto hym agaynst ye quene Isa∣bell his wyfe / & agaynst Edwarde his sone / anone hymselfe toke with hym sir Hugh Spenser ye sene / and syr Iohn o Arundell / & mayster Robert Badok his chaunceler a fals pylled prcest / and toke theyr waye toward Brystowe / & there ye kynge abode a lytell tyme / and made syr Hugh Spenser the fader as Cōstable & keper of ye castell.

16898,And syr Hugh ye fader came & put hym in the quenes grace & syr Edwarde her sone duke of Guy.
16899,But syr Hugh Spenser after the tyme y• he was taken he wolde neyther ete nor drynke / for he wyst well he shold haue no mercy / saue onely to be deed.
16900,And the quene & her coū seyle had ordeyned that he sholde haue ben done to deth at London / but he was so feble for his moche fastynge y• he was nygh deed / & therfore it was ordeyned y• he shold haue his iudgement at Herford And at a place of y• toure his hode was taken frō his heed / & also frō Robert Bal dok yt fals pylled clerke & y• kynges chaū celer / & mē set vpō theyr hedes chaplets of sharpe nettyls / & two squyers blewe in theyr eres wt two grete bugles hornes vpon the two prisouers / that one myght here theyr blowynge more than a myle.
16901,And one Symond of Redyng y• kynges marshall bare before them vpon a spere theyr armes reuersed: in token that they sholde be vndone for euermore.
16902,And on y• morowe was syr Hugh Spenser y• sone dampned to deth / & was drawen & han∣ged & heded / & his bowelles taken out of his body & brent / & after yt he was quar∣tred / & his .iiij.

16908,And the fals Baldok was sent to London / & there he dyed in prison amōge theues / for men dyd hȳ no more reuerence than they wold do to a dogge.
16909,And so dyed y• traytours of Englōd blis∣sed be god.
16910,And it was no wonder / for through theyr coūseyle y• good erle Tho mas of Lācastre was done to deth / & all that helde with Thomas of Lancastre through the traytours were vndone / & all theyr heyres disheryted.
16911,¶ How kyng Edward was put downe and his dignite taken from hym.
16912,ANd anone after as all this was done / quene Isabell & Edwarde her sone duke of Guyenne / & all the grete lordes of Englonde at one assent sente to kyng Edward to y• castell of Kenilworth where as he was in kepynge vnder the warde of syr Iohn Hachim that was y• bysihop of Ely / & of syr Iohn of Percy a baron / for bycause that he sholde ordeyn his parlyament at a certayne place in Englond / for to redresse and amende the estate of the realme.
16913,And kyng Edward them answered & sayd.
16914,Lordes sayd he ye se full well how it is / lo haue here my seale / and I gyue you all my power for to ordeyne a parlyament where that ye wyll.
16915,And than they toke theyr leue of hym & came agayn to y• barons of Eng∣londe.
16916,And whan they had the kynges patent of this thynge / they shewed it to the lordes.
16917,And than was ordeyned that the parliament shold be at westmynster at the vtas of saynt Hylary.
16918,And all the grete lordes of Englonde let ordeyne for them there agaynst that tyme that the parlyament sholde be.
16919,At whiche daye that y• parlyament was / the kyng wol∣de not come there for no maner thynge as he had set hymselfe & assygned.
16920,And neuerthelesse the barons sent vnto hym one tyme & other.
16921,And he swore by god∣des soule that he wolde not come there one fote.
16922,Wherfore it was ordeyned by all the grete Lordes of Englonde that he sholde no longer be kyng / but be depo sed / & sayd they wolde crowne Edward his sone y• elder yt was duke of Guyenne And sent tydynges vnto the kyng there as he was in warde vnder syr Iohn erle of Garen / & syr Iohn of Bothun yt was bysshop of Ely / & syr Henry Percy a ba∣ron / & syr Willyam Trussell a knyght y• was with y• erle Thomas of Lancastre for to yeld vp theyr homages vnto hym for all them of Englonde.
16923,And syr Wyl∣lyam Trussell sayd these wordes.
16924,Syr Edward / bycause that ye haue betrayed your people of Englond / & haue vndone many grete lordes or Englond without ony cause / ye shall be deposed / & now ye be withstande thanked be god.
16925,And also bycause that ye wold not come to y• par∣liament as ye ordeyned at Westmynster as in your owne lettre patent is contey∣ned / for to treate wt your lyege men as a kyng sholde.
16926,And therfore through all y• comyns assent & of all the lordes of Eng∣londe I tell vnto you these wordes.
16927,Ye shall vnderstande syr that the barons of Englond at one assent wyll that ye be no more king of Englond / but vtterly haue put you out of your ryalte for euermore.
16928,And the bysshop of Ely than sayd to the kynge.
16929,Syr Edwarde here I yelde vp feaute & homage for all y• archebisshops & bysshops of Englond & for all y• clergy.
16930,Than sayd syr Iohn erle of Garen.
16931,Syr Edward I yelde vp here vnto you feau te and homage for me & for all y• erles of Englōde.
16932,And syr Henry Percy gaue vp also there his homage for him & for all y• barons of Englonde.
16933,And than sayd syr William Trussell.
16934,I yelde vp now vnto you syr myn homage for me & for all the knyghtes of Englonde / & for all them y• holde by sergeaūtry or by ony other ma∣ner thynge of you / so y• from this day af terward ye shall not be claymed kynge / nor for kynge be holden.
16935,But from this tyme afterwarde ye shall be holden for a singuler man of all y• people.
16936,And so they went thens to London / where y• lordes of Englonde abode them / & syr Edward abode in prison i good kepyng.
16937,And this was on the daye of y• cōuersyon of saynt Paule / in the .xx.
16938,yere of his regne.
16939,¶ Of the prophery of Merlyn de∣clared of kynge Edwarde the sone of kynge Edward the fyrst.
16940,OF this kyng Edward prophecyed Merlin & sayd y• there sholde come a gote out of Carre yt shold haue hornes of syluer / & a berde as whyte as snowe / and a droppe shold come out of his nose∣thrylles yt sholde betoken moche harme honger & dethe of people / & grece losse of his londe.
16941,And that in y• begynnynge of his regne sholde be haūted moche leche∣ry.
16942,And he sayd sothe / alas the tyme for kyng Edward yt was kyng Edwardes sone was borne at Carnaruan in Wales For sothe he had hornes of syluer and a berd as whyte as snowe whan he was made prȳce of Wales / to moche he gaue hym to ryot and to foly.
16943,And sothe sayd Merlyn in his {pro}phecy / that there shold come out of his nose a droppe.
16944,For in his tyme was grete honger among y• poore people / & stronge dethe amonge y• ty the that dyed in strange londe with sorowe & in warre in Scotlond.
16945,And afterward he lost Scotlonde & Gascoyn & moche le chery in his dayes was haūced.
16946,¶ Also Merlyn sayd yt this gote sholde seke the floure of lyfe & of deth.
16947,And he sayd so the for he spoused Isabell y• kynges syster of Fraūce.
16948,And in this tyme Merlyn sayd that there shold be made brydges of folk vpon dyches of the see.
16949,And y• was well seen at Bannockesbourne in Scotlonde whā he was discōtyted there of y• Scot∣ces.
16950,And Merlyn tolde also that stones sholde fall from castels / & many townes shold be made playne.
16951,And he sayd sothe For whan kynge Edward was discom¦fyted in Scotlonde & came than south∣warde / the Scottes besyeged castels & dyd moche harme / & brent townes vnto the harde erth.
16952,¶ And afterward Mer∣lyn tolde that an egle sholde come out of Cornewayle that sholde haue fethers of golde / that of pryde sholde haue no pere / and he shold despyse lordes of blode / and after he shold dye through a bere at Ga∣uersyche / & that prophecy was full well knowen & foūde soche.
16953,For by the egle is vnderstande syr Pyers Ganaston / that than was erle of Cornewayle / whiche was a wonders proude man / & despised the barons of Englonde / but afterward he was heded at Gauersyche through ye erle of Lancastre & the erle of warwyk.
16954,¶ And Merlyn tolde that in this tyme it sholde seme that the bere sholde brenne and that batayle shold be vpon an arme of the see in a felde arayed lyke a shelde where sholde dye many whyte hedes / & he sayd sothe.
16955,For by the brennynge of ye bere is betokened grete drede through cuttynge of swerdes at that batayle of Myton / for there came ye Scottes in ma¦ner of a shelde in a wynge / & slewe men of religyon / preestes and seculers / wher fore the Scottes called that batayle in despyte of Englysshmen the whyte ba∣tayle.
16956,¶ And after Merlin sayd that the foresayd Bere sholde do the Gote moche harme / & yt sholde be vpon ye south west / and also vpon his blode.
16957,And sayd also yt the Gote shold lese moche dele of his lon∣de / tyll the tyme that shame sholde hym ouercome / & than he shold clothe hym in a lyons skynne / & sholde wynne agayne that he had lost / & more through people that sholde come out of the north west / yt sholde make hym to be fered and hym a∣uenge vpon his enemyes through coun¦seyle of two owles / that fyrst shold be in peryl to be vndone.
16958,And those two owles sholde go ouer see in to a straūge londe / & there dwell a certayn tyme / & after shold returne agayn in to Englond / & shold do moche harme to many one / & that they sholde coūseyle ye Gote to meue warre a∣gaynst the foresaid bere / & the gote & the owles sholde come to an arme of ye see at Burton vpon Trent / & sholde go ouer / & that for drede the bere sholde flee with a swan in his cōpany to Bury towarde ye north through an vnkynde outpulter / & that ye swan thā shold be slayne wt sorow and the bere shold be slayne full nye his owne nest / yt shold stande vpon Poūtfret vpon whome the sonne sholde shede his bemes / & many folke shold seke hym for his vertue.
16959,And he sayd sothe.
16960,for ye good erle Thomas of Lācastre was borne in the north west / & cosyn to ye kynge & his vncles sone / & by lawe he made ye kynge lese moche lōde yt he had purchased wyl fully tyll at ye last the kynge toke therof shame / & hymselfe fylled wt cruelte.
16961,And after gate agayne yt he had lost & moche more / through helpe of folk comyng out of ye northwest / by whom he was drad / & auenged hȳ on his barons through coū¦seyle of ye two Spēsers yt afore were out lawed for theyr wickednes / & after came agayne out of Fraūce / & so moche these Spensers coūseyled ye kynge yt he shold warre vpon Thomas of Lancastre / so yt the kyng & the Spensers and the erle of Arundell and theyr power mette with Thomas of Lancastre at Burton vpon Trent / and hym there discomfyted / and syr Vmfrey erle of Herford was in his company.
16962,And after fledde the foresayd Thomas and Vmfrey with theyr com∣pany to Burbrygge / metynge with syr Andrewe of Herkela / that is called ye vn∣kynde outpulter / and also syr Symond Warde erle of Yorke they came & met wt Thomas of Lātastre wt an huge compa¦ny / & them there discōsyted / & in y• discō∣siture y• crle of Herford was slayne vpon the brydge cowardly with a spere in the foūdement / & the erle Thomas was ta∣ken & ladde to Poūtfret / & than was he heded besyde his owne castell.
16963,But after¦ward many hym sought for myracles y• god dyd for hym.
16964,And in y• tyme Merlyn sayd / for sorowe and harme sholde dye a people of his londe / wherfore many lon¦des sholde be vpon hym the more bolder And he sayd sothe / for bycause of his ba∣rons that were put to deth for saȳt Tho¦mas quarell of Lancastre / people of ma∣ny londes became the bolder for to meue warre vpon theyr kyng / for theyr blode was turned to many nacyons.
16965,And af∣terward Merlyn tolde & sayd yt the fore∣sayd owles sholde do moche harme vnto the floure of lyfe & deth / and they sholde brynge her to moche dysease / so that she sholde go ouer see in to Fraūce for to ma∣ke peas to y• floure delyce / & there sholde abyde tyll on a tyme her sede shold come and seke her / and there they shold abyde bothe tyll y• tyme that they sholde clothe them with grace / & those two owles she sholde seke & put them to pyteous deth.
16966,And that prophecy was well knowen / & was full sothe.
16967,For syr Hugh Spenser the fader & syr Hugh the sone did moche sorowe and persecucyon vnto the quene Isabell through theyr {pro}curemēt to her lord y• kyng.
16968,So they ordeyned amonge them y• she was put vnto her wages / y• is to saye .xx.
16969,shillynges in y• daye / wher fore the kyng of Frauce her broder was sore alwyed / & sent in to Englonde by his lettres vnto kynge Edward y• he sholde come vnto his parlyament to Parys in Fraūce.
16970,But kynge Edwarde was sore adradde to come there / for he wende to haue be arested tyll that he had made a∣mendes for the trespace that syr Hugh Spenser the fader & the sone had done / & for y• harme y• they had done to the quene Isabell his syster.
16971,Wherfore through her ordynaūce & cōsent of y• Spensers y• quene Isabell went ouer see in to Frau∣ce for to make accorde bytwene kyng Ed¦warde & the kyng of Fraūce her broder.
16972,And there dwelled she in Fraūce tyll Ed¦ward her eldest sone came for to seke her and so they dwelled there bothe tyll that alyaūce was made bytwene them & the gentyl erle of Henaud / yt yf they wt theyr vertue myght destroye & ouercome y• ves nym & the falsnes of the Spensers that syr Edward sholde spouse dame Philip the worshypfull lady & the erles dough∣ter of Henaud.
16973,Wherfore the quene Isa∣bell & Edward her sone / & syr Edmonde of wodstocke the kynges broder of Eng∣lond / & syr Iohn of Henaud / & syr Rogrt Mortimer of Wygmore / & syr Thomas Rocelyn / & syr Iohn of Cromwell / & syr Willyam Trussell / & many other of the alyaunce of the gentyll erle Thomas of Lancastre yt were exiled out of Englōde for his quarel / & were disherued of theyr londes / ordeyned them a grete power & arryued at Herewich in Suffolke.
16974,And soone after they pursued the Spensers tyll yt they were taken & put to pytcous deth / as before is said / & theyr company also / for y• grete falsnes that they dyd to kynge Edward and to his people.
16975,And Merlyn sayd also more y• the gote sholde be put to grete disrase & grete anguysshe & in grete soro wehe sholde lede his lyfe.
16976,And he sayd sothe / for after y• tyme that kyng Edward was taken he was put in to warde tyll that y• Spensers were put to deth / & also bycause he wolde not come to his parlyamēt at London as he had ordeyued & assygned hymselfe vnto his haronage / & also wolde not gouerne and rule his people nor his realme as a kynge sholde do.
16977,Wherfore some of y• ba∣rons of Englōde came & yelded vp theyr homages vnto hym for them and all the other of the realme on the daye of y• con∣uersyon of saynt Paule / in y• yere of his regne .xx.
16978,And they put hym out of his royalte for euermore / & euer he lyued af∣terward in moche sorowe & anguysshe.
16979,LVdouicus was emperour after Henry .iiij.
16980,This Lodewik was duke of Bauare / & he despysed the crownacyon of y• pope / wherfore y• pope deposed him / and moche labour & many peryls he had after / & he troubled gret∣ly the vnite of holy chirche.
16981,Than was chosen agaynst hym Frederyke duke of Austryche.
16982,And he ouercame the duke / & abode a rebellyon to his ende / & in grete peryll to his soule.
16983,And at the last Karo∣lus was chosen agaynst hym / the whi∣che preuayled / & sodeynly Lodewyk fell down of his hors and decessed.
16984,¶ Iohn Maundeuyll a doctour of physyk and a knyght was borne in Englonde aboute this tyme.
16985,And he made a meruaylous pylgrymage / for he went almoost about all y• worlde / & he wrote his dedes in thre languages / & decessed & was buryed at saynt Albons.
16986,¶ Benedictus the .xxij.
16987,was pope after Iohn .vij.
16988,This man was a monke / and in all his youth he was of good cōuersacyon / and a doctour of diuinite.
16989,And whā he was made pope he reformed y• ordre of saynt Benet in that thynge y• was necessary.
16990,And he was an harde man to graunte benefyces / leest he had graunted it to an vnconnynge man.
16991,He made a decretall y• whiche began Benedictus de{us} in donis suis.
16992,And he was very cruell ī his fayth And for y• of some men was lytell loued.
16993,He was so stoute a man that almoost he wolde not knowe his owne cosyns.
16994,¶ Of kynge Edwarde the thyrde after the conquest.
16995,AFter this kyng Edward of Car∣naruan regned syr Edwarde of Wyndsore his sone / y• whiche was crow¦ned kynge & anoynted at Westmynster / through coūseyle & consent of all y• grete lordes of y• realme y• sondaye on Candel∣masse euen / in y• yere of grace.
16996,that was of age at y• tyme but .xv.
16997,And for bycause y• his fader was in¦warde in the castel of Kenilworth & also was put downe of his royalte / y• realme of Englonde was without kyng from y• feest of saint Katherin in the yere aboue sayd vnto the feest of Candelmasse.
16998,And than were all maner plees of y• kynges benche astent.
16999,And than was cōmaun∣ded to all y• sheryues of Englōd through wrytte to warne y• partyes to defendaū¦tes through somnynge agayn.
17000,And also ferthermore y• al prisoners y• were in the kȳges gayles y• were attached through sheryues / shold be let go quyte.
17001,¶ Kyng Edwarde after his crownacyon at the prayer & besechynge of his lyege men of the realme graūted thē a chartre of sted∣fast peas to all them y• wold aske it.
17002,And syr Iohn of Henaud & his company toke theyr leue of the kyng & of y• lordes of the realme / & turned home to theyr own coū¦tre agayn / & eche of them had full ryche gyftes / euery man as he was of value & of estate.
17003,And than was Englond in rest & peas / & grete loue bytwene the kyng & his lordes.
17004,And comynly Englysshmen sayd amōge them y• the deuyl was deed But the innumerable tresour of y• kyng his fader / & the tresour of the Spensers bothe of the fader & of y• sone / & of y• erle of Arundell / & of mayster Robert Baldoc y• was y• kynges chaūceler was departed after y• quene Isabelles ordynaūce & syr Roger Mortimers of wygmore / so that the kynge had no thynge therof / but at her wyll & her delyueraūce / nor of theyr londes / as afterwarde ye shall here.
17005,¶ How kyng Edward went to Stan∣hope for to mete the Scottes.
17006,ANd yet in y• same tyme was the kyng in the castel of Kenilworth vnder y• kepynge of syr Henry that was erle Thomas broder of Lācastre y• than was erle of Leycestre / & the kyng graū∣ted hym y• erledom of Lancastre / that y• kyng his fader had seased ī to his hādes & put out Thomas of Lancastre his bro¦der.
17007,And so was he erle of Lancastre & of Leycestre / & also steward of Englōde as his broder was in his tyme.
17008,But syr Ed¦ward that was kyng Edwardes fader made sorowe wtout ende / for bycause he myght not speke wt his wyfe nor wt his sōne / wherfore he was ī moche mischefe For though it were so y• he was lad & ru∣led by fals coūseyle / yet was he king Ed¦wardes sone called Edward wt the longe shankes / & came out of y• worthiest blode of all y• worlde / & they to whom he was wont to gyue grete gyftes & large / were moost preuy wt the kyng his sone / & they were his enemyes bothe by nyght & by daye y• {pro}cured to make debate & contake bytwene hym & his sone and Isabel his wyfe.
17009,But y• frere prechers were to him good frendes euermore / & cast bothe by nyght & by day how they myght brynge hym out of prison.
17010,And amonge theyr cō¦pany y• the freres had pryuely brought there was a frere y• called Dunhened / & he had ordeyned & gadred a grete compa¦ny of folke to kepe at y• nede / but y• frere was takē & put in y• castell of Poūfret / & there he dyed in pryson / & syr Henry erle of Lancastre that had y• kynges fader in kepyng through cōmaundement of the kynge delyuered Edward y• kynges fa∣der by endenture to syr Thomas of Ber∣keley / & so syr Iohn Mautreuers & they led him from y• castel of Kenilworth to y• castell of Berkley / & kept hȳ there safely And at cester next after his crownacyon the kynge ordeyned an huge hoost for to fyght agaynst y• Scottes.
17011,And syr Iohn the erles broder of Henaud came frō be∣yonde y• see for to helpe kyng Edward / & brought wt hym.
17012,men of armes / & arryued at Douer / & they had leue for to go forth tyl they came to yorke where as the king them abode / & y• Scottes came thyder to y• kynge for to make peas & ac∣corde / but the accordement lasted not by∣twene them but a lytell tyme.
17013,And at y• tyme the Englysshmen were clothed all in cotes & hodes peynted with & with floures full semely wt lōge berdes / & therfore the Scottes made a byll that was fastened vpon the chirche dores of saynt Peters towarde stengace / & thus sayd y• scripture in despyte of Englysshe¦men.

17017,And bycause y• the Henaudes came to helpe the king / theyr peas was cryed vpon payne of lyfe & lymme & in y• other halfe it was foūde by an enquest of y• cite that the Englysshmen began y• debate.
17018,¶ How y• Englysshmen stopped y• Scot¦tes in y• parke of Stanhope / & how they returned agayne into Scotlonde.
17019,ANd at y• tyme y• Scottes had as∣sembled all theyr power & came in to Englōde & slewe & robbed all y• they myght take / & also brente & destroyed all the north coūtree throughout tyll y• they came to the parke of Stanhope in wyre dale / & there y• Scottes helde them in a busshmēt.
17020,But whan y• kyng had herde through certayn spyes where y• scottes were / anone right wt his hoost besyeged them within y• foresayd parke / so that y• Scottes wyst not where to go out / but onely to theyr harmes / & they abode in y• parke .xv.
17021,days / & vytayles fayled them on euery syde / so y• they were gretly ap∣payred of theyr bodyes.
17022,And syth y• Bru¦te came fyrst in to Brytayn to this tyme there was neuer seen soo fayre an hoost what of Englysshmen & of alyens & of men on fote / the whiche ordeyned them for to fyght with the Scottes / through eggyng of syr Henry of Lācastre & of syr Iohn of Henaud y• wold haue gone ouer the water of wyth for to haue fought wt the Scottes.
17023,But syr Roger Mortymer consented not therto / for he had pryuely takē mede of the Scottes to helpe them that they myght go in to theyr countre.
17024,And this Mortimer coūseyled so moche Thomas of Brotherton y• erle Marshall that was kyng Edwardes vncle that y• foresaid Thomas sholde not assemble at that tyme vnto y• Scottes / & he assented but he wyst not the doynge bytwene the Scottes & the foresayd Mortimer.
17025,And bycause y• he was Marshall of Englōde & to hym perteyned euer y• vaūtwarde / he sent hastely to y• erle of Lancastre & to syr Iohn of Henaud that they shold not fyght with the Scottes / in preiudyce & harmyng of hym & his fee / & yf they did that they sholde stande to theyr owne pe¦ryll.
17026,And y• foresayd erle Marshall was al arayed wt his batayle at y• reredoos of the erle of Lācastre for to haue fought wt hym & wt his folke / yf he had meued for to fyght wt the Scottes.
17027,And in this ma¦ner he was deceyued / & wyst nothynge of the treason.
17028,And thus was the kyng principally deceyued.
17029,And whan it was nyght Mortymer that had the watche for to kepe of the hoost y• nyght / dystrou∣bled y• watche that nothynge myght be done.
17030,And in y• meane whyle y• Scottes stole by nyght toward theyr owne coun∣tree as fast as they myght.
17031,And so was the kynge falsly betrayed / that wende y• all the traytours of his londe had ben brought to an ende as it was said before Now here ye lordes how traytoursly y• kyng Edward was deceyued / and how meruaylously & boldly the Scottes dyd of warre.
17032,For Iames Douglas wt two hondred men of armes rode throughout all the hoost of kyng Edward / the same nyght y• Scottes escaped toward theyr owne coūtre as is aboue sayd tyll y• they came to y• kynges pauylyon / and slewe there many men ī theyr beddes / & cryed naward naward / & an other tyme a dou¦glas a douglas.
17033,Wherfore y• kyng that was in his pauilyon & moche other folk were wonders sore afrayde.
17034,But blissed be god y• kyng was not taken / & in grete peryll was than y• realme of Englonde.
17035,And y• nyght the mone shone full clere & bryght.
17036,And for all the kynges men the Scottes escaped harmeles.
17037,And on the morowe whan the kyng wyst that the Scottes were escaped in to theyr owne coūtre / he was wōders sory / & full herte¦ly wepte wt his yonge eyen / & yet wyst he not who had done hym y• treason / but that fals treason was full well knowen a good whyle after as the story telleth.
17038,Than kynge Edwarde came agayne to yorke full sorowfull / & his hoost depar∣ted / and euery man went in to his owne coūtree with full heuy chere and mour∣nynge semblaunt / & the Henaudes toke theyr leue & went in to theyr owne coun¦tre / & the king for theyr trauayle hugely rewarded them.
17039,And for bycause of that vyage the kynge had dyspended moche of his tresour & wasted.
17040,¶ And in that tyme were seen two mones in y• fyrma∣ment / that one was clere and that other was derke / as men myght se through y• worlde.
17041,And a grete debate was y• same tyme agaynst pope Iohn the .xxij.
17042,after saynt Peter / & the emperour of Almayn tho made hym emperour agaynst y• po∣pes wyll / y• tho helde his see at Auinyon Wherfore y• emperour made his crye at Rome & ordeyned an other pope y• hyght Nicholas y• was a frere Minour / & that was agaynst the ryght of holy chirche / wherfore he was cursed / & the power of that other pope soone was layd.
17043,And by¦cause y• suche meruayles were seen: men sayd y• the worlde was nygh at an ende.
17044,¶ Of the deth of kynge Edwarde of Carnaruan.
17045,ANd now go we agayn to syr Ed∣ward of Carnaruan y• was king Edwardes fader somtyme kyng of Eng¦londe / & was put downe of his dignite.
17046,Alas for his tribulacion & sorowe y• hym befell through fals coūseyle y• he loued & trusted vpon to moche / that afterwarde were destroyed through theyr falsnesse as god wold.
17047,And this Edward of Car∣naruan was in y• castell of Berkeley / vn¦der y• kepyng of syr Moryce of Berkeley and syr Iohn of Mautreuers / & to them he made his cōplaynt of his sorowe & of his disease.
17048,And ofte tymes asked of his wardeyns what he hadde trespaced a∣gaynst dame Isabell his wyfe & syr Ed¦ward his sone y• was made newe kyng that they wold not visyte hym.
17049,And thā answered one of his wardeyns & sayd.
17050,My worthy lorde dysplease you not y• I shall tell you / the cause is / for it is done them to vnderstande / y• yf my lady your wyfe come ony thynge nye you / that ye wolde her strangle & slee / & also that ye wolde do to my lorde your sone y• same.
17051,Than answered he with a symple chere Alas alas am not I in prison / and all at your owne wyll / now god it wote I ne∣uer thought it / & now I wolde y• I were deed / so wolde to god y• I were / for than were all my sorowe passed.
17052,It was not longe after y• the kyng through coūseyle of Roger Mortymer graūted y• warde & kepynge of syr Edward his fader to syr Thomas Toiourney / & to y• foresayd syr Iohn Mautreuers through the kinges lettre / & put out holly y• foresayd syr Mo∣ryce of the warde of the kyng.
17053,And they toke & lad the kyng to y• castell of Corf▪ y• whiche castel y• kyng hated as ony deth.
17054,And they kept hym there tyll it came vn to saynt Mathewes day in September in the yere of grace.
17055,that the foresayd syr Roger Mortimer sent y• maner of y• deth / how & in what wyse he shold be put to deth.
17056,And anone as y• fore¦sayd Thomas & Iohn had seen y• & cōmaūdement / they made kynge Ed∣warde of Carnaruan good chere & good solace as they might at y• souper / and no thynge the kyng wyst of y• treason.
17057,And whan tyme was for to go to bedde the kynge wente vnto his bedde & laye and slepte fast.
17058,And as the kyng laye & slepte the traytoures false for sworne agaynst theyr homage & feaute came pryuely in to y• kynges chambre / & theyr company with them / & layde an huge table vpon his wombe / & with men pressed & helde fast down the foure corners of y• table on his body / wherwith y• good man awoke and was wonders sore adrad to be deed there & slayne / & turned his body tho vp so downe.
17059,Than toke y• fals traytours & tyraūtes an horne & put it in to his foun¦dement as depe as they myght / & toke a spyt of coper brēnynge / & put it through the horne in to his body / and ofte tymes therwith thyrled his bowelles / & so they slewe theyr lord that nothynge was per¦ceyued / & was buryed at Glocestre.
17060,¶ How kynge Edward spoused Philip the erles doughter of Henaud at Yorke.
17061,ANd after Chrystmasse than next folowynge syr Iohn of Henaud brought with hym Philip his broders doughter yt was erle of Henaud his nece in to Englond / & kyng Edward spoused her at Yorke wt moche honour.
17062,And syr Iohn of Bothum bisshop of Ely and syr William of Melton archebysshop of yor¦ke sange the masse ye sonday on ye euen of the cōuersion of saint Paule / in ye yere of grace.
17063,But bycause that the kynge was yonge and tender of age whan he was crowned / full many wron¦ges were done whyle yt his fader lyued bycause yt he byleued the coūseylers that were fals aboute hym to do otherwyse than reason wolde / wherfore grete har∣me was done to ye realme & to ye kyng / & all men directed it to ye kynges dede / & it was not so / almyghty god it knoweth.
17064,Wherfore it was ordeyned at ye kynges crownyng yt the kyng for his tender age sholde be gouerned by .xij.
17065,of the gretest lordes of Englonde / without whome no thynge shold be done / that is to saye / the archebysshop of Caūterbury / the arche∣bisshop of yorke / the bisshop of wynche∣stre / & the bysshop of Herford / the erle of Lancastre / the erle Marshall / & ye erle of Kent yt were ye kynges vncles / & the erle of Garen / syr Thomas wake / syr Henry Percy / syr Olyuer of yngham / & Iohn of Roos barons.
17066,All these were sworne truly for to coūseyle ye kyng / & they shold answere euery yere in ye parlyamēt of yt that sholde be done in the tyme of theyr gouernall.
17067,But ye ordynaūce was soone vndone / & that was moche harme to all Englōde.
17068,For the kyng & all the lordes ye shold gouerne hym were gouerned and ruled after the kȳges moder dame Isa∣bell / & by syr Roger Mortimer.
17069,And as they wolde all thynge was done / bothe amonge hye & lowe.
17070,And they toke vnto them castels / townes / londes / & rentes / in grete harme & losse to the crowne / & of the kynges estate out of mesure.
17071,¶ How the peas was made bytwene ye Englisshmen & the Scottes / and also of iustyfyenge of Troylebaston.
17072,BYnge Edwarde at whytsontyde in the seconde yere of his regne / through the coūseyle of his moder & syr Roger Mortimer ordeyned a parlyamēt at Northamton.
17073,And at that parlyamēt the kyng through theyr coūseyle / & none other of the londe within age graunted to be accorded with the Scottes in this maner.
17074,That all the feautees and homa¦ges that the Scottes sholde do vnto the crowne of Englonde forgaue them for euer more by his chartre ensealed.
17075,And forthermore an endenture was made of the Scottes vnto kynge Edwarde that was kyng Henryes sone / whiche enden¦ture they called ragman / in the whiche were cōteyned al ye homages & feautees Fyrst of the kynge of Scotlonde & of all the prelates / erles & barons of ye realme of Scotlonde / wt theyr seales set theron / and other chartres & remembraunces yt kynge Edwarde and his barons had of theyr right in ye foresayd realme of Scot¦lond / it was forgyuen them agaynst ho¦ly chirche.
17076,And also with ye blacke crosse of Scotlonde / the whiche ye good kynge Edwarde conquered in Scotlonde / and brought it out of the abbey of Scone / yt is a full precyous relyke.
17077,And also for∣thermore he relesed & forgaue all the lon¦des that the barons of Englonde had in Scotlonde by olde conquest.
17078,¶ And this peas for to be hold and last the Scottes were bounde vnto the kyng in .xxx.
17079,M. poūde of syluer to be payed within thre yere / that is euery yere .x.
17080,M. poūde by euen porcyons.
17081,And forthermore aboue all this they spake bytwene the partyes aboue sayd / that Dauyd Dritonautier that was kynge Robert the Brus sone ye fals tyraunt & fals forsworne agaynst his othe yt arose agaynst his lyege lorde the noble and good kyng Edward / and falsly made him kyng of Scotlōde / that was of ye age of .v.
17082,And so through this cursed counseyle Dauid spoused at Barwyk dame Ione of the toure / that was kynge Edwardes syster / as ye gest telleth vpon Mary Magdaleyns daye / in ye yere of grace.
17083,to grete harme & empayrynge of all the kynges blode / wherof that gentyll lady came / alas ye tyme / for wonders moche was that fayre damoysell desparaged syth that she was maryed agaynst all the comyns assent of Englonde.
17084,And fro the tyme that Brute had conquered Al∣bion / & named the londe after his owne name Brytayn / that now is called Eng¦londe / after the name of Engyst / and so the realme of Scotlonde was holden of the realme of Englonde / & of the crowne by feaute & homage.
17085,For Brute conque∣red that londe / and gaue it to Albanack that was his seconde sone / and he called that londe Albayn after his own name / so that the heyres that came after hym sholde holde of Brute and of his heyres / that is to saye of ye kynges of Brytayne by feaute & homage.
17086,And frō that tyme vnto this tyme of kynge Edwarde / the realme of Scotlonde was holden of the realme of Englonde by feaute & seruyce as aboue is sayd in ye Cronycles of Eng¦londe & of Scotlonde / and bereth wyt∣nes more plenarly.
17087,¶ And cursed be the tyme that this parliament was holden at Northamton.
17088,For there through fals coūseyle the kyng was there falsly dys∣heryted / & yet he was within age.
17089,And yet whan that kyng Edward was put out of his royalte of Englonde / yet men put not hym out of ye feautees & seruyce of Scotlonde / ne of the fraūchyses dys∣heryted hym for euermore.
17090,And neuer∣theles the grete lordes of Englōde were agaynst to confyrme ye peas & the trewse aboue sayd / saue onely quene Isabell yt was the kynges moder Edwarde / and the bysshop of Ely / and the lorde Mont∣mer.
17091,But reason & lawe wolde not yt a fy¦nall peas sholde be made bytwene them without the comyn assent of Englonde.
17092,¶ Of the debate yt was bytwene quene Isabell & syr Henry erle of Lācastre & of Leycestre / & of the rydynge of Bedford.
17093,WHan ye foresayd Dauid had spou∣sed dame Ione of the toure in the towne of Barwik (as before is sayd) the Scottes in despyte of the Englysshmen called dame Ione ye coūtesse make peas for the cowardly peas that was ordey∣ned.
17094,But the kynges persone bare al the wyte & blame with wronge of the ma∣kynge of the accorde.
17095,And all was done through the quene & Roger Mrtymer.
17096,And it was not longe after that ye quene Isabell ne toke in to her handes all the lordshyp of Pountfret almoost all ye lon∣des that were of ony value that apper∣teyned to the crowne of Englonde.
17097,So yt the kynge had not for to dyspende but of his vses & of his excheker.
17098,For the quene Isabell & Mortimer had a gree meyny of theyr retynue that folowed euermore the kynges courte / & went & toke ye kyn∣ges pryces for her peny worthes at good chepe.
17099,Wherfore the coūtre yt they came in / were full sore adrad and almoost de∣stroyed of them.
17100,Thā began ye cominalte of Englonde for to haue enuy to Isabell the quene that so moche loued her before whan she came agayne fro Fraūce for to pursue the fals traytours ye Spensers.
17101,And in that same tyme ye false traytour Robert of Holand that berayed his lord syr Thomas of Lancastre / was than de¦lyuered out of pryson / & was wonders preuy with ye quene Isabell & also with Roger Mortimer.
17102,But that auayled hȳ but lytell / for he was taken at Myghel∣masse next folowyng as he rode toward the quene Isabell to London / & syr Tho¦mas wyther smote of his heed besydes the towne of saynt Albons.
17103,And this syr Thomas dwelled with syr Henry erle of Lancastre / & he put hym asyde for drede of the quene / for she loued hym wonders moche / & prayed vnto ye kyng for hym yt the same Thomas myght be exiled out of Englonde.
17104,And ye noble erle syr Henry of Lancastre had oftentymes herde the comyn damour of ye Englysshmen / of yt disease that was done in Englonde / & al¦so for dyuers wronges yt were done to ye comyn people.
17105,Of the whiche the kyng bare the blame wt wronge.
17106,For he was yonge & tender of age.
17107,And thought as a good man for to do awaye and slake the sclaundre of ye kynges person / yf that he myght in ony maner wyse / so as ye kyng was therof nothynge gylty / wherfore he was in peryll of his lyfe.
17108,And so he assembled all his retenaunces & went & spake wt them of ye kynges honour / & al∣so for to amende his estate.
17109,And syr Tho¦mas Brotherton erle Marshall / and syr Edmond of wodstok yt were the kynges vncles / & also men of Londō made theyr othe for to maynteyn hym in that same quarell.
17110,And theyr cause was this / that the kyng sholde holde his hous and his meyny as a king ought to do / & haue all his ryalte / & that ye quene Isabell shold deliuer out of her handes in to ye kynges handes all maner lordshyppes / rentes / townes & castels yt apperteyned vnto ye crowne of Englōde as other quenes dyd before her / and meddle with none other thynge.
17111,And also that syr Roger Morti∣mer shold abyde & dwell vpon his owne londes / for ye whiche londes he had hol∣pen to disheryte moche people / in so mo∣che that ye comyn people were destroyed through wrongfull takynge.
17112,And also to enquyre how & by whome the kynge was betrayed & falsly deceiued at Stan hope / and through whose coūseyle that the Scottes went away by nyght from the kynge.
17113,And also how and through whose coūseyle ye ordynaunce that was made at the kynges crownacyon was put downe / that is for to saye / that the kynge for amendement and helpyng of the realme / and in honour of hym sholde be gouerned and ruled by .xij.
17114,of the gre∣test and wisest lordes of the realme / and without them sholde nothynge be graū¦ted ne done (as before is sayd) the whi∣che couenauntes were malycyously put downe from the kynge / wherfore many harmes shames & reproues haue fallen to the kyng and his realme.
17115,And that is to vnderstand for as moche as Edward somtyme kyng of Englonde was ordey¦ned by assent of the comynalte in playne parlyament for to be vnder the warde & gouernaunce of Henry erle of Lancastre his cosyn for saluacyon of his body / he was taken out of ye castel of Kenworth where he was in warde / & through co∣lour of quene Isabell & of Mortimer wt∣out cōsent of ony parliament they toke & lad hȳ where as neuer after none of his ynrede myght speke wt hȳ / & after tray toursly murdred hym / for whose deth a∣rose a sclaundre through all christendom whan it was done.
17116,And also ye tresour yt syr Edward of Carnaruan left in many places englōd & in wales was wasted & borne awaye without ye wyll of kyng Edward his sone / in destruccion of hym and all his folke.
17117,¶ Also through whose coūseyle that the kyng gaue vp ye kyng∣dom of Scotlonde / for ye whiche realme the kynges auncesters had full sore tra∣uayled / and so dyd many a noble mā for theyr ryght / & was delyuered to Dauid that was Robert ye Brus sone al ye right that no ryght had to ye realme / as al the worlde it wyst.
17118,¶ And also by whome ye charters & remembraūces yt they had of the right of Scotlōde were taken out of the tresoury & taken to the Scottes the kynges enemyes / to the dysherytyng of hym & his successours / & to grete harme of his lyeges / & grete reprefe to all Eng∣lysshmen for euermore.
17119,¶ Also wherfore ame Ione of ye toure kyng Edwardes syster was disparaged & maryed to Da¦uid yt was Robert ye Brus sone / yt was a traytour & enemy to Englōd / & through whose coūseyle she was taken in to our enemyes handes out of Englōde.
17120,¶ And in the meane whyle the good erle Henry of Lancastre & his cōpany toke coūseyle how these poyntes aboue said might be amended to ye worship of ye king & to his profyte / & to ye profyte also of his lyeges.
17121,¶ And the quene Isabell through con∣iectynge & subtylte & also of Mortymer let ordeyn a parlyament at Salysbury.
17122,And at that parlyamēt was Mortimer made erle of Marche agaynst all the ba∣rons wyll of Englonde in preiudyce of ye kyng & his crowne.
17123,And syr Iohn of El∣tham ye kynges broder was gyrt with a swerde of Cornewayle / & tho was called erle of Cornewayl.
17124,And euermore quene Isabell {pro}cured so moche anenst her sone the king / yt she had ye warde of ye foresaid syr Edward & of his londes.
17125,And at that parlyamēt ye erle of Lancastre wold not come / but ordeyned his power agaynst quene Isabell & Mortymer / and men of London ordeyned them with .v .C.
17126,Whan quene Isabell wyst of the doynge / she swore by god & by his na¦mes full angerly / that in an euyll tyme he thought vpon those poyntes.
17127,Than sent the quene Isabell & Mortmer after theyr retynue / & after ye kynges retynue so that they had ordeyned amōge them an huge hoost.
17128,And they so coūseyled the kyng / that vpon a nyght they rode.
17129,xxiij myle towarde Bedford / where as ye erle of Lancastre was with his company & thought to haue destroyed hym / & that nyght she rode besyde the kyng her sone as a knight armed for drede of deth.
17130,And it was done the kynge to vnderstande ye the erle Henry of Lācastre & his compa∣ny wolde haue destroyed the kyng & his coūseyle for euermore / wherfore ye kyng was somdele towardes hym heuy and anoyed.
17131,¶ Whan ye erle Marshall & the erle of Kent the kynges broder herde of these tydynges / they ode so in message bytwene them / that the kyng graunted hym his peas to the erle Henry of Lan∣castre for a certayne raunsom of.
17132,But that was neuer payed after warde.
17133,And these were ye lordes ye helde with syr Henry of Lancastre / syr Henry Beamont / syr Fouk fitz war syr Tho¦mas Rocelyn / syr Willyam Trussell syrr Thomas wyther / & aboute an ondred knyghtes moo than were to hym cōsen ted / & all those were exled through coū∣seyle of quene Isabell and of Mormer for Mortymer wayted for to haue theyr lōdes yf yt he might through ony maner coniecting / for he was to cous & had to moche wyll / & that was grete pye.
17134,¶ How kynge Edwarde went ouer the see for to do his homage to the kynge of Fraunce for the duchy of Guyen.
17135,IT was not longe after ye the kyng of Fraūce through coūseyle of his Douzepers sent vnto kynge Edward of Englonde that he sholde come to Parys and do his homage (as reason it wolde) for y• duchy of Guyen / & so through coū∣seyle of y• lordes of Englonde kynge Ed∣ward went ouer y• see / & at y• Ascencyon tyde he came to Parys the thyrd yere of his regne for to do his homage vnto the kyng of Fraūce.
17136,And the kyng receyued his homage / & made of hym moche ioye & worship.
17137,But whā kyng Edward had done his homage / hastely he was sente for in to Englonde through y• quene Isa¦bell his moder / & anone hastely he came agayn in to Englond vpon whytsonday wtout takynge leue of y• kyng of Fraūce / wherfore he was wonders wroth.
17138,¶ How syr Roger Mortimer bare hym proudly and wonders hye.
17139,ANd now shall ye here of syr Ro∣ger Mortimer of wygmore that desyred & coueyted to be at an hye estate so that y• kyng graūted hym to be called erle of Marche / throughout all his lord∣shyp.
17140,And he became so proude & so hau∣teyn y• he wold lese & forsake the name y• his elders had euer before / & for y• cause he let call hym erle of Marche / and none of the comyns of Englonde durst call hȳ by other name.
17141,For he was called so by the kynges crye / y• men sholde call hym erle of Marche.
17142,And Mortimer bare hȳ so hauteyne & so proude / that wonder it was for to wyte / & also dysguysed hym with wonders ryche clothes out of all maner of reason / bothe of shapynge & of werynge.
17143,Wherof y• Englysshmen had grete wonder / how & in what maner he myght contryue or fynde suche maner pride / & they sayd amōge them comynly that his pryde sholde not longe endure.
17144,And y• same tyme sir Geffrey Mortimer that was Mortimers sone let call hym kyng of foly / & so it befell afterwarde in dede.
17145,For he was so full of pryde and of wretchednes / that he held a roūde table in Wales to all men that came thyder / & coūterfeyted the doynge & the maner of kyng Arthurs table / but openly he fay∣led.
17146,For the noble kyng Arthur was the moost noble lorde of renome y• was in all the world in his tyme / & yet came neuer none suche after / for al y• noble knyghtes in all chrystendom of dedes of armes as∣sayed dwellyng wt kyng Arthur / & helde hym for theyr lord & souerayn.
17147,And that was well seen / for he conquered in ba∣tayle a Romayn that was called Froll / and gate of hym the realme of Fraūce / & slewe hym wt his own handes.
17148,And also he faught with a gyaunt y• was called Dinabus & slewe hym / y• had rauysshed fayre Eleyn that was kynge Howelles nece kynge of lytell Brytayn.
17149,And after he slewe in batayle y• emperour of Rome that was called Lucie / that had assem∣bled agaynst kynge Arthur for to fyght with hym so moche people of Romayns & Phethis & sarasyns / y• no man coude nombre them / & he discomfited them all as y• story telleth.
17150,¶ And in y• same tyme the comyn voyce spronge in Englonde through coniectynge & ordynaūce of the frere prechers / that syr Edward of Car naruan / that was kyng Edwardes fa∣der / of whome the gest telleth / sayd y• he was alyue in y• castell of Corf / wherfore al y• comyns of Englōde almoost were in sorowe & drede whether it were so or not For they wyst not how traytoursly Mor¦timer had done hym to be murdred.
17151,¶ How Edmond of wodstok y• was erle of Kent & the kynges broder Edward of Carnaruan was heded at Wynchestre.
17152,ANd on a certayne tyme it befell so that syr Edmond of wodstock erle of Kent spake vnto the pope Iohn the .xxij.
17153,at Auinyon & sayd y• almyghty god had often tymes done for Thomas lone of Laneastre many grete myracles to many men & women / y• were through dyuerse maladyes vndone (as vnto the worlde) & through his prayer they were brought to theyr helth / & so syr Edmond prayed y• pope hertely y• he wolde graūt hȳ grace y• the foresayd Thomas might be translated.
17154,But y• pope sayd nay / that he shold not be translated vnto the tyme he were better certyfyed of the clergy of Englonde and seen by theyr obedyence what thynge god had done for y• loue of saynt Thomas of Lancastre after y• sug¦gestyon that y• foresayd erle of Kent had made to hym.
17155,And whan this Edmond saw y• he might not spede of his purpose as touchyng the translacyon / he prayed hȳ of coūseyle as touchyng syr Edward of Carnaruan his broder / & sayd not lon¦ge ago he was king of Englonde / what thynge myght best be done as touching his deliueraūce / syth y• a comyn fame is through Englonde y• he is alyue & safe.
17156,Whan the pope herde hym tell y• syr Ed∣ward was alyue / he cōmaūded the erle vpon his benyson y• he sholde helpe wt all the power y• he myght y• he were delyue∣red out of prison / & saue his body in all y• he myght / & to brynge this thynge to an ende he assoyled hym & his cōpany (a pe na et culpa) & al tho y• holpe to his deliue¦raunce.
17157,Than toke Edmond of wodstok his leue of the pope & came agayne in to Englonde.
17158,And whan syr Edmond was comen / some of y• frere prechers came & sayd y• syr Edwarde his broder yet was alyue in y• castell of Corf / vnder y• keping of syr Thomas Gurney.
17159,Tho sped hym the foresayd Edmōd as fast as he might tyll he came to y• castel of Corf / & aqueyn¦ted hym and spake so fayre with Iohn Daueryll / that was constable of y• same castell / & gaue him ryche gyftes to haue acqueyntaunce of hym & to knowe of his coūseyle.
17160,And thus it befel y• the foresayd syr Edmond prayed specially to tell hym pryuely of his lorde his broder syr Ed∣ward / yf y• he lyued or were deed / & yf he were alyue he prayed hȳ ones to haue a syght of hym.
17161,And this syr Iohn Daue¦ryll was a hye herted man & full of cou∣rage / & answered shortly to syr Edmond & sayd / that syr Edward his broder was in helth & vnder his kepyng / & durst not shewe hym to no man syth it was defen∣ded hȳ in y• kynges half Edward y• was Edwardes sone of Carnaruan / & also by the cōmaūdemēt of quene Isabell y• kyn¦ges moder / & of syr Roger Mortymer / y• he shold shewe his body to no man of the world / saue onely to them vpō lyf & lȳme & disheryting of his heyres for euermore But the fals traytour falsly lyed / for he was not in his warde / but he was takē thens & lad to y• castell of Berkeley by syr Thomas Gurney / by cōmaūdement of Mortimer tyll he was deed as before is sayd / but syr Edmōd of wodstok wyst no thynge y• syr Edwarde his broder was deed / whervpon he toke a lettre to kyng Edward his broder as to his worthy lor¦de.
17162,And receyued y• lettre of hȳ & behight hym to do his message wtout ony fayle.
17163,And with y• syr Edmond toke leue of the foresayd Iohn & went in to his own coū¦tre & lordshyp ī Kent y• he had there.
17164,And anone as this same Iohn wyst y• syr Ed¦mond was gone in to Kent his own lord¦ship / he went in all the haste y• be might fro the castel of Corf & came to syr Roger Mortimer / & toke hym y• lettre y• syr Ed∣mond of wodstok erle of Kent had taken hym closed & ensealed wt his owne seale.
17165,And whan syr Roger Mortimer had re∣ceyued the lettre / he vnclosed it & sawe what was conteyned therin / & began to rede it / wherof y• begȳnynge was this.
17166,¶ Worshyps & reuerence with broders legeaunce and subiecyon.
17167,Syr knyght worshipful & dere broder / yf it please you I praye you hertely y• ye be in good com forte / for I shall so ordeyne for you / that ye shall come out of prison & be deliuered of that disease that ye be in.
17168,And vnder∣stande of your grete lordshyp y• I haue to myne assentyng almoost all the grete lordes of Englonde with all theyr appa¦rayle / y• is to saye / with armure / wt tre∣sour without nombre / for to maynteyne your quarell / so ferforth that ye shall be kynge agayn as ye were before / & that they haue sworne to me vpō a boke / & as well prelates as erles & barons.
17169,Whan syr Roger Mortimer sawe & vnderstode the myght & the strengthe of the lettre / anone his herte for wrath began to boll & euyll hert bare toward syr Edmond of wodstok y• was erle of Kent / & wt all the haste that he might he went vnto dame Isabell y• quene y• was y• kynges moder & shewed her syr Edmondes lettre / his wyll & his purpose / & how that he had coniected & ordeyned to put downe kyng Edward of wyndsore her sone of his ry∣alte & of his kyngdom.
17170,Now certes syr Roger sayd she / hath syr Edmōd done so now by my faders soule sayd she I wyll be therof auenged / yf that god graūt me lyfe / & that in a shorte tyme.
17171,And with y• the quene Isabel went to king Edward her sone there as he was at the parlya∣ment at Wynchestre for to amende the wronges & the trespaces that were done amonge the people of his realme / & she toke and shewed hym the lettre that syr Edmond of wodstock had made and en∣sealed with his owne seale / and badde hym vpon her blessynge that he sholde be auenged vpon syr Edmonde as vpon his deedly enemy.
17172,Than was the quene sore wroth towarde syr Edmonde erle of Kent / and cessed neuer to praye vnto her sone tyll that he had sent in all the haste after hym.
17173,And vpon that the kyng sent by his lettres after syr Edmond of wod∣stok / that he sholde come & speke wt hym at Wynchestre all maner thynges lefte.
17174,And whan syr Edmond sawe y• the king sent after hym with his lettres ensealed he hasted hym in all that he myght tyll that he came to wynchestre.
17175,But whan the quene wyst that syr Edmonde was comen to wynchestre / anone she went & prayed so fast vnto kynge Edwarde her sone that y• good erle was arested anone and ladde vnto y• barre before Robert of Hamond y• was Crowner of the kynges housholde / & he assocyed to hym syr Ro∣ger Mortimer.
17176,And than spake the fore sayd Robert & said.
17177,Syr Edmond erle of Kent / ye shall vnderstāde that it is done vs to wyte / & prȳcypally vnto our lyege lorde the kynge Edwarde of Englonde almyghty god hym saue & kepe / that ye be his deedly enemy & a traytour / & also a comyn enemy vnto the realme / & that ye haue ben aboute many a daye for to make preuy delyueraūce of syr Edward somtyme king of Englonde your broder the whiche somtyme was put downe of his royalte by y• comyn assent of y• lordes of Englonde in appeasynge of our lorde the kynges estate / & also of his realme.
17178,Than answered the good man & sayd.
17179,Forsothe syr vnderstande well y• I was neuer traytour to my kyng / ne to the re∣alme / & that I do me on god & on all the worlde / & therfore by my kynges leue I shall it preue & defende as a man ought to do.
17180,Than sayd Mortymer.
17181,Syr Ed∣monde it is so ferforth knowen y• it may not be well gaynsayd / & that in presence of all that be here it shall be well proued Now had this fals Mortimer the same lettre that syr Edmond had taken to syr Iohn Daueryll in the castell of Corf for to take to kyng Edward his broder that syr Edmonde wyst not of / ne supposed nothynge y• syr Iohn Daueryll had ben so fals to deliuer his lettre in suche wyse to Mortimer / & thought no maner thyn∣ge of the lettre.
17182,Than Mortimer sayd to syr Edmonde & shewed y• lettre sealed / & asked him yf that he knewe that lettre & the seale.
17183,This syr Edmōd loked theron & auysed hym longe tyme on y• print of y• seale / for he myght not se y• lettre wtin / & wyst well y• it was his seale / & thought that it had bē some lettre y• had borne no grete charge / & thought nothynge on y• other lettre / & sayd openly in herynge of them all.
17184,Ye forsothe this is my seale / & I wyll it not forsake.
17185,Loo sayd Morty∣mer / syrs ye here all what he hath sayd & that he knowlegeth y• this is his lettre & his seale / & now ye shall here what is conteyned therin.
17186,And than this Morti∣mer opened y• lettre y• he had folden a fore togyder / & red it openly worde by worde in hering of them all.
17187,And whan y• lettre was red he sayd / loo syrs ye haue herde all that here is wryten / & that he hath knowleged y• this is his lettre & his seale & he may not go therfro.
17188,And than they cryed & gaue dome that he sholde be han¦ged & drawen & his heed smyttē of in ma¦ner of a traytour / & he & his heyres dys∣heryted for euermore / & so he was ladde forth & put in to pryson.
17189,And whan this was done / & y• quene wyst that he was dampned by waye of y• lawe bothe of lyf and lymme / & his heyres dysheryted for euer more / through open knowlegynge in playn court / wherfore them thought that it were good y• the foresayd syr Ed∣mond were hastely slayne without wy∣tynge of y• kyng / or els the kynge wolde lyghtly forgyue hym his deth / & than it sholde turne them to moche sorowe / so as he was empeched.
17190,And anone the quene through counseyle of Mortimer / & wtout ony other counseyle / sente in haste to the baylyfe of wynchestre y• he sholde sinyte of syr Edmondes heed of wodok erle of Kent without ony maner abydynge or respyte / vpon payne of lyfe & lymme / & that he shold haue none other execucyon bycause of taryenge / not withstandyng the iudgement.
17191,Than toke y• baylyfe syr Edmond out of pryson / & ladde hym be∣syde y• castel of wynchestre / & there they made a gongfermer to smyte of his dyed for none other durst do it.
17192,And so he dyed there / alas y• whyle / y• is to say y•.
17193,day of October / the thyrde yere of kyng Ed∣wardes regne.
17194,And whan y• kyng wyst therof / he was wonders sory / & let bury hym at ye frere Minours at winchestre.
17195,¶ Of the deth of syr Roger Mor∣tymer erle of Marche.
17196,ANd so it befell at y• tyme that syr Roger Mortimer erle of marche was so proude & so hawteyne y• he helde no lord of the realme his pere.
17197,And than became he so couetous that he folowed dame Isabell the quenes courte y• was kyng Edwardes moder / & beset his pe∣nyworthes wt the offycers of the quenes houshold in y• same maner y• the kynges officers dyd.
17198,And so he made his takyng as touchynge vytayles / & also of carya∣ges / & all he dyd for bycause of epenses and to gadre tresour / & so he dyd with∣out nombre in all that he myght.
17199,Than made he hym wonders preuy with the quene Isabell / and so moche lordshyp & retynue he had / that all the grete lordes of Englonde of hym were adrad.
17200,Wher∣fore the kynge & his coūseyle towardes hym were agreued / & ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym through pure reason and lawe / bycause that kynge Edward that was the kynges fader trayoursly through hym was murdred in y• castell of Corf / as before is sayd more playn∣ly in the same parte of this boke of his deth.
17201,And some that were of the kynges counseyle loued Mortimer / & tolde hym in preuite how that the kyng & his coun¦seyle were aboute frō daye to daye hym for to destroye & vndo.
17202,Wherfore Morti∣mer was sore anoyed and angry as the deuyll agaynst them yt were of ye kynges coūseyle / & sayd he wolde of them be a∣uenged how so euer he toke on.
17203,It was not longe afterward that king Edward and dame Philip his wyfe / & dame Isa¦bell the kynges moder / & syr Roger Mor¦tymer ne went vnto Notyngham there for to soiourne.
17204,And so it befel that quene Isabell through counseyle of Mortimer toke to her the keys of ye gates of ye castel of Notyngham / so that no man myght come in nor out by nyght / but through cōmaūdement of Mortimer / ne ye kynge nor none of his coūseyle.
17205,And that tyme it befell so that Mortimer as a deuyll for wrath boyled / & also for wrath ye he had agaynst the kynges men / & pryncypally agaynst them yt had accused hym to the kyng of ye deth of syr Edward his fader.
17206,And pryuely a counseyle was taken by∣twene quene Isabell & Mortymer & the bysshop of Lyncolne and syr Symond of Bedford & syr Hugh of Trompyngton & other preuy of theyr coūseyle for to vndo them al ye had accused Mortimer vnto ye kynge of his faders deth of treason & of felony.
17207,Wherfore all those yt were of the kynges coūseyle whā they wyst of Mor¦timers castynge / pryuely came to kyng Edwarde & sayd that Mortimer wolde destroye them bycause they had accused hym of kyng Edwardes deth his fader and prayed hym yt he wolde maynteyne them in theyr right.
17208,And these were the lordes yt pursued this quarell / syr Williā of Mountagu / syr Vmfrey de Boghun / syr Williā his broder / syr Rauf of Staf∣ford / syr Robert of Herford / syr Willyam of Clynton / syr Iohn Neuyll of Nornby and many other of theyr consent / and all these swore vpon a boke to maynteyne the quarell in as moche as they myght.
17209,And it befell so after that syr Wyllyam of Mountagu ne none of ye kynges fren∣des must not be herborowed in the castel for Mortimer / but went and toke theyr herborowe in dyuers places of ye towne of Notyngham.
17210,And tho were they sore adrad lest that Mortimer shold destroye them / and in haste came vnto kyng Ed∣ward syr Willyam of Moūtagu yt than was in ye castell / and pryuely tolde hym that he nor none of his company sholde not take Mortimer without counseyle & helpe of Wyllyam of Eland constable of the same castell.
17211,Now truly sayd ye king I loue you well / & therfore I counseyle you that ye go to the foresayd constable and cōmaunde hym in my name that he be your frende and your helpe for to take Mortimer / all thynge left vpon peryll of lyfe & lymme.
17212,Than sayd Moūtagu / syr my lord graūt mercy.
17213,Than went forth the foresayd Moūtagu and came to the constable of the castell / and told hym the kynges wyll.
17214,And he answered & sayd the kynges wyll shold be done in as mo∣che as he myght / and that he wolde not spare for no maner deth / and so he swore and made his othe.
17215,Than sayd syr Wil∣lyam of Mountagu to the constable / in herynge of all them that were helpyng vnto the same quarell.
17216,Now certes dere frende / vs behoueth to werke and do by your aduyse for to take Mortymer / syth that ye be keper of the castell & haue the keys in your warde.
17217,Syr sayd the con∣stable ye shall vnderstande that ye gates of the castell ben locked with the lockes that dame Isabell sente hyther / and by nyght she hath the keys therof & layeth them vnder the leuesell of the bedde tyll on the morowe / and so ye may not come in to the castell by the gates in no ma∣ner of wyse / but I knowe an aley that stretcheth out of the warde vnder ye erth in to ye foresayd castel / yt goth in to ye west whiche aley dame Isabell the quene ne none of her men / nor Mortymer ne none of his cōpany knoweth it not.
17218,And so I shall lede you through ye aley / and so ye shall come in to the castel wtout espyenge of ony men yt be your enemyes.
17219,And the same nyght syr William Moūtagu & all the lordes of his quarell / & the same con∣stable also wente to hors them / & made semblaūt as it were for to go out of Mor¦timers syght.
17220,But anone as Mortimer herde these tydynges / he wende yt they wold haue gone ouer see for fere of hym And anone he & his company toke a coū∣seyle amonge them for to lette theyr pas∣sage / & sent lettres anone to the portes / so that none of the grete lordes sholde go home to theyr own coūtrees but yf they were arested & taken.
17221,And amōge other thynges Willyam Eland constable of ye foresayd castell / priuely lad syr William of Moūtagu & his company by the fore∣sayd waye vnder the erth tyl they came in to the castel / & went vp in to the toure where as Mortymer was in.
17222,But syr Hugh of Trompyngton theym escryed hydously & sayd.
17223,A traytours it is all for nought that ye be comē in to this castell ye shall dye yet an euyl deth euerychone And anone one of them yt was in Moun¦tagues cōpany by with a mace & smote the same Hugh vpon ye heed yt the brayn brast out & fell on ye groūde / & so dyed he an euyll dethe.
17224,Than toke they Morty∣mer as he armed hym at ye toures dore whan he herde ye noyse of them for drede And whan quene Isabell sawe ye Mor∣tymer was taken / she made moche so∣towe in hert / and these wordes to them sayd.
17225,Now fayr syrs I pray you yt ye do no harme to his body a worthy knyght our welbeloued frende & our dere cosyn.
17226,Thā went they thens & came & brought Mortimer & presented hym vnto kynge Edward.
17227,And he cōmaunded to brynge hym in safe warde.
17228,But anone as they that were consentyng vnto Mortimers doynge herde tell yt he was taken / they went and hydde them / and purly by nyght wente out of the towne eueryche in to his countree with an heuy herte & mournyng chere / and lyued vpon theyr londes as well as they myght.
17229,And so that same yere yt Mortymer was taken he had at his retynue .ix.
17230,score knyghtes without squyers and sergeauntes of ar¦mes and fote men.
17231,And than was Mor∣tymer ladde to London / & syr Symond of Bedford was ladde with hym / and was taken to the constable of the toure to kepe.
17232,But afterwarde was Morty∣mers lyf examyned at Westmynster be∣fore the kynge & before all the grete lor∣des of Englonde / for peryll that myght fall to the realme / & to enquyre also whi¦che were consentynge to syr Edwardes deth the kynges fader / and also through whome the Scottes escaped fro Scan∣hope in to Scotlonde without the wyll of kyng Edward.
17233,And also how yt char∣ter of Ragman was delyuered vnto the Scottes / wherin the homages & frau∣tees of ye lordes of Scotlonde were con∣teyned / that the Scottes sholde do euer more vnto the Englysshe kynge for the realme of Scotlōde / wherfore in his ab∣sence he was dampned to be draw & hanged for his treason.
17234,And this mys∣chefe came to hym on saynt Andrewes euen / in the yere of ye incarnacyon of our lorde Iesu Chryst.
17235,¶ Now kyng Edward gate agayn vnto hym gracyously ye homages & faues of Scotlonde / wherof he was put out through false coūseyle of quene Isabell his moder & syr Roger Mortymer / that was newly made erle of March.
17236,NOw haue ye herd how syr Iohn Bayloll in the tyme of peas was chosen to be kyng of Scotlonde / bycause that he came of ye eldest doughter of the erle Dauid of Huntyngton yt was kyng Alysaunders broder of Scotlond yt dyed without heyre of his body begoten.
17237,And how this Iohn made his feaute and ho¦mage to kyng Edward Henryes sone ye thyrde for his londes of Scotlonde.
17238,And how he afterwarde wtsayd his homage through coūseyle of the Scottes / in the yere of our lorde.
17239,and sent vnto the pope through a fals suggestion that he made his othe vnto the foresayd kyng Edward ouer his estate & his wyl of the whiche othe ye pope hym assoyled through his bulles to hȳ sent.
17240,And ano∣ne as kyng Edward wyst therof / he or∣deyned anone his barons & came to Bar¦wyk & conquered the towne / at whiche conquest there were slayne .xxv.
17241,and Bayloll yt was kyng of Scot¦londe came & yelded hym to good kynge Edward / & the kyng afterward delyue∣red him out of ye toure of London / & all ye grete lordes wt hym that tho were taken at Barwyk / & gaue them saufconduyte to go in to Scotlonde.
17242,And the Scottes ith through theyr falsnes warred vpon the good kyng Edward.
17243,And whan syr Iohn Bayloll kyng of Scotlonde sawe all this he went ouer see vnto Dunpier and lyued there vpon his londes as wel as he myght tyll yt the Scottes wold a∣mēde them of theyr mysoedes & trespace & ad wt hȳ syr Edward his sone / wher∣fore ye Scottes in despyte of hym called hym syr Iohn Turnlabaerd / for bycause that he wolde not offende ne trespace a∣gaynst ye good kyng Edward of Englon¦de.
17244,And so he forsoke his realme of Scot¦londe / and set therof but lytel pryce.
17245,And this syr Iohan dwelled longe tyme in Fraūce tyll yt he dyed there.
17246,And syr Ed∣ward his sone receyued his herytage / & dyd homage to ye kyng of Fraūce / for his londes of Dunpier.
17247,And so it befell after¦ward that Edward yt was Iohn Bay∣lols sone had wt hym a squyer of englōde that was borne in yorkshyre / yt was cal¦led Iohn of Barnaby / & this Edwarde Bayloll loued hym moche / & was nygh hym and full preuy.
17248,And so this Iohn of Barnaby was in debate with a frensshe man in ye towne of Dūpier / & so he slewe hym & went his waye in all ye haste yt he myght in to ye castell for to haue helpe of his lord.
17249,And anone came ye officers of ye towne to take Iohn of Barnaby as a fe∣lon / & syr Edward his lord holpe hym & rescowed hym / & by night made him go out of ye castell / & so he went his waye & came in to Englonde wtout ony harme.
17250,And whan ye kyng of Fraūce sawe yt syr Edward had rescowed his felon / he be∣came wonders wrothe agaynst syr Ed∣ward / & anone let arest hym / & toke in to his hādes all his londes.
17251,Than dwelled syr Edward in pryson vnto ye tyme yt syr Henry of Beaumont came in to Fraūce / the whiche Henry was somtyme erle of Angos in Scotlonde through his wyfe & was put out therof whā ye accordemēt was bytwene Englonde and Scotlond through quene Isabell & Roger Morti∣mer & theyr cōpany / for ye maryage yt she made bytwene Dauyd yt was Robert ye Brus sone & dame Ione of ye toure kyng Edwardes syster of Englōde / & well vn¦derstode this yt at ye ende he shold come to his ryght / but yf it were syr Edwarde Bayloll yt was ryght heyre of ye realme of Scotlonde.
17252,And the kyng of Fraunce Lowys loued moche this syr Henry / & he was with hym ful preuy / & thought for to make a delyueraūce of syr Edwar¦de Bayloll yf he myght in ony maner of wyse.
17253,Tho prayed he ye kyng ye it wolde please his noble grace to graūt hym syr Edward Baylols body vnto ye next par∣lyament that he myght lyue wt his own tentes in the meane tyme / & yt he myght stande to be iudged wt his peres at ye par¦lyament.
17254,And ye kyng graūted hym his prayer / & made the foresayd Edward to be delyuered out of pryson in the maner aboue said.
17255,And anone as he was out of prison / syr Henry toke hym forth wt hym & ladde hym in to Englōde / & made hym dwell pryuely at ye maner of Sandhall vpon Ouse in Yorkeshyre with the lady Vescy.
17256,And so he ordeyned him there an huge retynue of Englysshemen & also of alyens for to conquere agayne his hery∣tage.
17257,And so he gaue moche siluer to the sowdyours & to alyens for to helpe hym And they behyght for to helpe hym in yt they myght / but they fayled hym at his moost nede.
17258,And at yt tyme Donald erle of Moryf herde tell how yt syr Edwarde Baylol was priuely come in to Englōde & came to hym & made grete ioye of his comynge agayn / and sayd to hym & be∣hyght hym yt all ye grete lordes of Scot∣londe shold be to hym attendaūt / & shold holde hym for kynge as ryght heyre of Scotlōde / & dyd to hȳ homage & feaute.
17259,Than came syr Henry of Beaumont to kynge Edwarde of Englonde / & prayed hym in ye waye of charite that he wolde graūt of his grace to syr Edward Bay∣loll that he myght safely go by londe frō Sandhal vnto Scotlōde to cōquere his ryght & herytaunce in Scotlonde.

17273,The erle of Fyffe was tho sore & full yll ashamed / that so lytell a company had dyscomfyd hym and shamefully put hym & all his com∣pany that were alyue for to flee.

17277,And whan the burgeyses of the towne herde how the erle of Fiffe was dyscōfyted through Bayloll / they were fore adrad / & brake theyr brydges yt they had made ouer ye water of Erne / so that Baylol myght not go ouer / wherfore he lodged hym there all yt nyght / but lytell hede he toke of rest / & sayd vnto his peo∣ple.
17278,Now dere lordes ye knowe full well that we be now lodged bytwene our ene¦myes / & yf they may vs hampre there is no bote but deth / wherfore yf we abyde styll here all this nyght / I wene it shall turne vs to moche harme.
17279,For ye power of Scotlonde may euer wexe & encreace and we may not so do / & we be but lytell people agaynst them / wherfore I praye you for ye loue of almighty god make we vs bolde & hardy / & yt we may myghtely take the Scottes this night / and boldly warre vpon them / & let vs pursue them this nyght / & yf they be through vs tra∣uayled & se our hardynes / other scottes that se them so trauayled and wery / the sorer wyll they be adrad wt vs to fyght / & fyersly than shall we fyght with them & on them pursue / so yt through y• grace of god al y• worlde shall speke of y• dough tynes of our chyuairy.
17280,And syrs vnder∣stande well that al the company y• came with syr Edward Bayloll graūted well to y• coūseyle / & were therof ryght glad / and anone pursued vpon the Scottes y• they became wonders wery.
17281,And Bay∣loll & his company sore folowed them / & did them moche harme & sorow through theyr assaut / so y• they myght not for fe∣blenes them helpe / and for lytell people.
17282,But tho sayd y• Scottes amonge them / what is now befall that so lytell people as Bayloll hathe in wynge dothe vs so moche trauayle & sorowe.
17283,Now certes it semeth vs that he werketh by grace / for he is wonders gracyous in his quarell / & we certes shal be deed or that we may come to hȳ vs for to yelde / syth that his fader set of vs no pryce.
17284,And amonge all other thynges Bayloll & his people pas∣sed the water of Erne / so that syr Roger of Swynerton the sone was fyers & an∣gry & went forth / & they sawe people of armes full well arayed / and forth they went vnto them & with them faught / & slewe & toke as many as wolde abyde.
17285,And neuertheles at yt assaut they wende it had ben the grete hoost of Scotlonde.
17286,And whan it came to the morowe they gadred them togyder and rested them a whyle.
17287,And whyle ye englisshmen rested them / the noble baron Thomas Vescy & the noble baron of stafford pricked theyr horses vp & down by ye hylles for to kepe the estres of y• coūtree / & as they prycked vp and down they sawe a grete hoost of good araye ordeyned in theyr wynges with helmes and sheldes shynynge co∣mynge vpon them.
17288,And there came tho two lordes agayn to Baylols folke / and sayd.
17289,Now for the loue of god be of good cōforte / for ye shall haue batayle anone right.
17290,And tho spake syr Fouke ye sone of Gareyne a baron of grete renome and of dedes of armes.
17291,Syrs vnderstāde what I wyll saye.
17292,I haue seen many dyuers wynges / as wel amonge sarasyns and iewes as amonge y• scottes / & yet sawe I neuer the fourth parte of the wynge fyght / & therfore yf ye wyll abyde our enemyes we be ynough to fight against them.
17293,But yf we be not of good hert & of good courage we be but lost / & therfore for the loue of god let vs take to vs good herte / & let vs be bolde / & thynke we ne∣uer on our wyues ne on our childrē / but onely to cōquere our enemyes in batayle & through the helpe of our lorde god we shall them ouercome.
17294,And with yt came the hoost of the Scottes towarde them full surely & agaynst syr Edward Bay∣loll in thre bataylles well arayed in ar∣mure / & wonders fyersly they came to∣warde Baylols company.
17295,But whā syr Donald erle of Marcil that was with y• Scottes sawe all this / he said to Robert Brus the sone of Robert the Brus these wordes.
17296,Syr Roberte sayd he / full sore me forthynketh at my herte yt these peo∣ple that Bayloll hathe brought wt hym sholde dye with dynt of scottes swerdes lyth yt they be chrysten men as we be / & therfore me thȳketh yt it were grete cha∣rite to sende vnto them for to yelde them to our mercy / & raunsom them through greuous raunsom / for as moche as they haue takē our londe & done yll.
17297,Now cer∣tes sayd syr Robert y• Brus / I haue wel perceyued that yu art an enemy & a tray∣tour to Scotlonde / syth that yu wylt con∣sent to saue our deedly enemyes / yt haue done vs so moche sorowe & shame / & now it semeth well that ye be of theyr assent.
17298,Now certes Roberte (sayd syr Donald) falsly ye lye / I am not of theyr company ne of theyr cōsent / & that hastely ye shall se / for I wyll fyght wt them rather than ony of this cōpany / & certes syr Roberte sayd he I shal in maugre of thy heed as∣sayle them or thou.
17299,And with that they prycked theyr stedes fyersly on Gaskmo re / & theyr wynges them folowed on a rēge / & tho came they & mette wt Bayloll & his cōpany at an hangynge bough of the more in a strayte passage / and so fast they hasted them vnto the englysshmen that thousandes fell to the groūde eche ouer other in to an hepe bothe hors & mā Syr Bayloll & his men myghtely stode agaynst them & fast slewe the Scottes to the groūde / & many they fore woūded so longe tyll that they stode vpon them & foyned them wt theyr swerdes & speres through theyr bodyes / and full sore they were trauayled vpon them / tyll yt they became wōders wery / & wyst not what for to do.
17300,And y• Scottes that were lefte alyue fledde away for to saue themselfe in the best maner that they myght.
17301,And tho pursued them syr Edwarde Ba and his men / & slewe of them tyll it was night.
17302,And fro thens they went to saynt Iohns towne / and toke it & helde them there / and vytayled themselfe at theyr owne wyll / for they foūde ynough wher with to make them mery.
17303,Than made Bayloll his men yt were wounded go to shyppe for to sayle in to Englonde to theyr woūdes.
17304,And in y• tyme there was a flemyng in y• see a stronge thefe & a rob¦ber yt was called Crab / & this flem was dryuē out of Flaūdres for his wyc∣kednes / & therfore he came in to scotlond to holde with y• scottes / & dyd as mee harme to y• Englisshmē as he myght to And this Crab mette this Bayes men in y• see yt were woūded before in baraye that were sent agayn in to Englonde to hele theyr woūdes / & this Crab gaue to them a grete assaure and wold haue slayne them.

17307,And anone tolde to the Scottes how that he was disco∣fyted of y• Englysshmen that were woū¦ded at Gaskmore y• went towarde Eng∣londe for to hele theyr woūdes / & sayd to the scottes yt they sholde haue no power ne myght nor grace agaynst Edwarde Bayloll / bycause that he dyscomfyted & empayred all the chiualry of Scotlonde with a handfull of men as to accompte agaynst the Scottes that were slayne / wherfore he coūseyled to remeue y• siege from saynt Iohns towne / & kepe them in y• best maner that they myght.
17308,The Scottes vnderstode yt Crab sayd sothe / & forsoke ye syege & went thens by nyght & holpe themselfe in y• best maner yt they myght.

17310,And he them receiued frely / & fro thens he went to ye abbey of Scone / & there he was crowned kyng of Scotlonde / & after he let crye his peas throughout all the londe.
17311,And at yt same tyme it befell that kynge Edward helde his parlyament amonge his lyeges at newe castell vpon Tyne / for to amende y• trespaces & the wronges yt had ben done in his londe / & syr Edward Bayloll king of Scotlonde came to hym thyder / & dyd to hym homage & feaute for y• realme of Scotlonde.
17312,And in this maner kyng Ed¦ward of Englōde gadred agayn his ho∣mages & feautees of Scotlond / wherof he was put out through counseyle & as∣sent of dame Isabell his moder / & of syr Roger Mortimer erle of Marche.
17313,Than toke Baylol kyng of Scotlonde his leue of kynge Edward of Englonde / & went thens in to his owne londe of Scotlonde & set but lytell by suche as had coūseyled & holpen hym in his quarell / wherfore they went from hym / & went & lyued by theyr londes & rentes in Scotlond.

18310,And than anone our lor¦des yt were embassadours toke theyr le∣ue & came in to Englonde agayne & tolde the kynge & his couseyle of the vngoodly answere yt they had of the Dolphin / & of the present y• whiche he had sente to our kynge.

18312,And than anone the kynge sent for all the lordes & helde a grete coūseyle at Westmynster / & told to them the answer yt they had of the Dol¦phin & of his worthy present yt he sent to hym & to his lordes to playe wtall.
18313,And there ye kyng & his lordes were accorded that they shold be redy in armes wt theyr power in the best araye yt myght be done and gete all the men of armes & archers that myght be goten / & all other stuffe yt longed to warre / & to be redy wt all theyr retynue to mete at Southhampton by Lāmasse nexte folowynge without ony delaye / wherfore ye kynge ordeyned his nauy of shyppes with all maner stuffe & vytayle that lōged to suche a warryour of all maner ordynaunce in the hauen of Southhampton to ye nombre of .CCC.
18314,And thā fell there a grete dysease and a foule myschefe.
18315,For there were thre lordes whiche that the kyng trusted moche on / & through false coue∣tyse they had purposed & ymagined the kynges deth / & thought to haue slayne hym & all his bretherne or he had taken the see / whiche thre lordes were named thus / syr Rycharde erle of Cambrydge broder to ye duke of yorke / ye seconde was the lord Scrope tresourer of Englōde / y• thyrd was sir Thomas Gray knyght of the North coūtree.
18316,And these thre lordes aforesayd for lucre of money had made a promesse vnto y• Frensshmen for to haue slayne kyng Henry the fyfth and all his bretherne by a false trayne sodeynly or they had ben ware.
18317,But almyghty god of his grete grace helde his holy hande ouer them & saued them from these pe∣rillous meiny.
18318,And for to haue done this they receyued of y• frensshmen a millyon of gold / & that was there openly proued And for theyr fals treason they were all thre iudged to deth / & this was y• iudge∣ment / that they sholde be ladde through Hampton / & without northgate there to be heded.
18319,And thus they ended theyr ly∣ues for theyr fals couetyse and treason.
18320,And anone as this was done the kynge & all his meyny made them redy & went to shyppe and sayled forth with .xv.
18321,hon∣dred shyppes / & arryued within Seyne at Kydecause vpon our ladyes euen the Assumpcyon in Normandy wt all his or∣dynaūce / & so went forth to Harflet / & he besyeged the towne all about by londe & also by water / & sent to the capytayne of the towne & charged hym to delyuer the towne.
18322,And ye capytayne sayd that he de¦lyuered hym none / ne none he wolde hȳ yelde / but badde hym do his best.
18323,And than our kyng layde his ordinaūce vnto the towne / that is to saye / gonnes / engy¦nes & tripgettes / and shotte & cast at the walles & eke at the towne / & cast downe bothe toures & towne & layde them on y• erth / & there he played at the tenes with his hard gonne stones.
18324,And they y• were with in y• towne whan they sholde playe theyr songe was well away & alas that euer ony suche tenes balles were made / & cursed al tho y• warre began / & y• tyme that euer they were borne.
18325,¶ And on the morowe y• kyng let crye at euery gate of the towne that euery man shold be redy on the morowe erly to make assaute to y• towne.
18326,And Willyam Boucher & Iohn Graūt with .xij.

18328,dayes respyte & trewse yf ony rescowe myght come to them / & els to yelde vp ye towne to hym wt al theyr goodes.
18329,And than the kyng sent forth y• capytayne & kepte the remenaūt styll wt hym.
18330,And y• lord Gau∣corte yt was capytayne of y• towne went forth to Roen in all ye haste vnto the Dol∣phyn for helpe & socour / but there was none ne no man of rescowe / for the Dol∣phyn wold not abyde.
18331,And thus this ca¦pytayne came agayne vnto the kynge & yelded vp ye towne / & delyuered hym the keys.
18332,And than he called his vncle ye erle of Dorset & made hym capytayne of the town of Harflet / & deliuered him y• keys & bad hȳ go & put out all y• frēsshe people bothe men womē & children / & stuffe his town of Harflet wt englysshe people.

18335,And whā y• kyng sawe y• this town was well stuffed bothe of vytayles & of men / this worthy prince toke his leue & went toward Calays by lond / & y• frensshmen herde of his comynge / they thought for to haue stopped hȳ his waye y• he sholde not passe that waye / in all y• haste y• they myght brake al y• bridges where as ony passage was for hors & man / in so moche that there myght no man passe ouer the ryuers neyther on hors ne on foe / but yf he shold haue bendrowned.
18336,And therfore our king wt all his people went & sought his way ferre vp toward Paris / & there was all y• ryall power of Fraūce assem∣bled & redy to gyue hym batayle / & for to destroye all his people.
18337,But almyghty god was his guyde & saued hȳ & all his meyny / & defended hym of his enemyes power & purpose thanked be god y• saued so his owne knyght & kyng in his ryght full tytel.

18340,Than our kynge gadred all his lordes & other people aboute & bad them al to be of good chere / for they shold haue a fayre & a gracyous victory & the better of all theyr enemyes / & prayed them to make thē redy to y• batayle / for he wolde rather dye y• daye in the felde / than to be taken of his enemyes / for he wold neuer put y• realme of Englonde to raūsom for his persone.
18341,And y• duke of Yorke fell on his knees & besought y• kyng of a bone / y• he wold graūt hym yt daye y• vaūtward in his batayle / & the kyng graūted hym his askyng / and sayd gramercy cosyn of Yorke / & prayed hym to make hym redy.

18343,And al the nyght before y• batayle y• frensshmen made many grete fyers & moche reuell with howting & showting / & played our kyng & his lordes at y• dyse / & an archer alwaye for a blanke of theyr money / for they wend al had bē theyrs.

19690,Also y• archcbysshop of Caūterbury hath foure suffrigans in wales that ben Landaf / saynt Dauyes Bangor / & saynt aph.
19691,The archebys∣shop of yorke hath now but two bisshops vnder hym / y• is Durham & Caerleyll.
19692,And so ben but two prymates in Englonde / what of them shall do to the other / & in what mener poynt he shal be obedyent & vnder hym / it is fully contey¦ned within about y• yere of our lord god M .lxxij.
19693,tofore y• fyrst kynge Willyam & the bysshops of Englonde by cōmaunde¦ment of y• pope the cause was handled & treated bytwene the foresayd prymates & ordeyned & demed that the prymate of Yorke shal be subgecte to the prymate of Caūterbury in thynges y• lngen to the worship of god & to y• yleue of holy chir¦che / so that in what place so euer it be in Englonde y• the prymate of Caūterbury holde & constrayne to gader a coun¦seyle of clergye the pryate of Yorke is holden wt his suffrygans for to be there & for to be obedyent to y• ordinaunce that there shall be lawfully ordeyned.
19694,Whan the prymate of Caūterbury deed / the prymate of Yorke shall come to Caūter∣bury and wt other bysshops he shal sacre hym y• is chosen / & so wt other bysshops he shall sae his owne prymate.
19695,Yf the prymate of Yorke be deed / his successour shall come vnto y• bysshop of Caunterbu¦ry / & he shall take his ordynaūce of hym & take his othe with possessyon & lawful obedyence.
19696,After aboute the yere of our lorde .xi.
19697,in y• t of kyng Ry¦charde ben reasons set for y• ryght party for eyther prymate / & what one prymate dyd to y• other in tyme of Thurstinus of Thomas and of other bisshops of Yorke from the conquest vnto kynge Henryes tyme y• thyrde.
19698,Also there it is sayd how eche of them starte frō other.
19699,This place is but a forspekynge & not a full treatyse therof / therfore it were noyful to charge this place with all suche reasons.
19700,¶ Of how many maner of people haue dwelled therin.
19701,BRitons dwelled first in this ylond the .xviij.
19702,yere of Hely y• prophete the .xj.
19703,yere of Solinus postam{us} kynge of Latyns .xiiij.
19704,yere after the takyng of Troy / ofore y• buyldynge of Rome.
19705,They came hy∣ther & toke theyr from Armonyk that now is that other Brytayne / they helde longe tyme the s coūtrees of y• .
19706,It bfe afterwarde in aspa∣ tyme duke of Rome / y• the Petes shypped out of in to / and were dryuen aboute w wynde / & entred in to the north co of Irlonde / and foūde there Sttes / & prayed them to haue a place to dwell in / and myght one gete.
19707,For Irlonde as Scottes sayd myght not sustayne bothe people.
19708,Scot¦tes sente the Pictes to the north syde of Englōde & behyght them helpe agaynst the Brytons y• were theyr enemyes / yf they wolde aryse / & toke them wyues of theyr doughters / vpon suche condicyon yf doubte fell / who sholde haue ryght to be kynge / they sholde rather chose hȳ of the moders side than of y• faders syde / of the women kynne rather than of y• men kynne.
19709,In Vaspasyan y• em∣perours tyme whan Mari{us} Aruiragus sone was kyng of Brytons / one Rodryk kyng of Pictes came out of Scicia & be∣gan to destroye Scotlonde.
19710,Marius the kyng slewe this Rodryk / & gaue y• north party of Scotlonde y• hight Cathenesia to the men that were come with Rodryk & were ouercome by hym / for to dwell in But these men had no wyues / ne none myght haue of y• nacion of Brytōs / ther fore they sayled in to Irlonde / & toke to theyr wyues Irysshe mēnes doughters by y• couenaūt that y• moders blode shold be put tofore in successyon of herytage.
19711,Neuertheles Sirin{us} su{per} Virgiliūsayth y• Pictes agatirses y• had some dwellyng place about y• waters of Scicia / & they ben called Pictes of peyn¦tynge & smytynge of woundes / therfore they are called Pictes as peynted men.
19712,These men and these gothes ben all one people.
19713,For whan Maximus the tyraūt was gone out of Brytayne in to Fraūce for to occupy y• empyre.
19714,Than Gracian{us} and Valentinianus y• were bretherne & felowes of the empyre brought these go∣thes out of Scicia wt grete gyftes / wt fla¦terynge & fayre byhestes in to the north coūtree of Brytayne.
19715,For they were stal∣worth & stronge men of armes.
19716,And so these theues and brybouts were made men of londe & of coūtre & dwelled in the north coūtre / & helde there cytees & tow∣nes.
19717,Carancius the tyraunt slewe Bassianus / and gaue the Pictes a dwellyng place in Albama that is Scot¦londe / there they dwelled longe tyme af∣terward & medled with Brytons.
19718,Than sith the Pictes occupyed fyrst the north syde of Scotlonde / it semeth y• the dwellynge place y• this Carancius gaue them is y• south syde of Scotlonde / that stretcheth from the thwarte ouer walle of Romayns werke to y• Scottysshe see / and conteyneth Galleway and Lodouia that is Lodeway.
19719,¶ Therfore Bede .iij.
19720,speketh in this maner.
19721,Nan the holy man conuerted y• south Pictes.
19722,Afterward the Saxons came & made y• coūtre longe to Brenicia the north party of Northumberlonde / vnto y• tyme that Kynadius Alpinus sone kynge of Scot¦londe put out y• Pictes / & made y• coūtre that lyeth bytwene Twede & the Scot∣tysshe see long to his kyngdom.
19723,Afterwarde longe tyme y• Scot¦tes were led by duke Renda / & came out of Irlonde that is the propre countre of Scottes / & with loue or with strengthe made them a place fast by the Picces in the north syde of the arme of the see that breketh in to the londe in the west syde / that departed in olde tyme bytwene Bri¦tons & Pictes.
19724,Of this duke Renda the Scottes had y• name & were called Dal∣rendin{us} / as it were Rendaes parte / for in theyr speche a parte is called dal.
19725,The Pictes myght haue no wyues of Brytons / but they toke them wyues of Iryssh Scottes / and promysed them fayre for to dwell with them / & graūted them a londe by y• see syde / there y• see is narowe.
19726,That londe is now called Galle¦way.
19727,Irysshe Scottes lon∣ded at Argall y• is Scottes clyf for Scot¦tes londed there for to do harme to y• Bri¦tons / or for y• place is next to Irlōd for to come a londe in Brytayn.
19728,And so the Scottes after y• Britons & Pictes made y• thyrde people dwellynge in Bry¦tayn.
19729,¶ R. Than after y• came y• Saxōs at the prayenge of the Brytons to helpe them agaynst y• Scottes & Pictes.
19730,And the Britons were soone put out in to wa¦les / & Saxons occupyed the londe lytell & lytell / & efte more to the Scottysshe see And so Saxons made the fourth maner of men in y• ylonde of Brytayn.
19731,For Saxons & Angles came out of Germania / yet some Brytōs that dwel nygh call them shortly Germayns ¶ R. Neuertheles aboute y• yere of our lorde.
19732,Egbartus kynge of West∣saxon cōmaūded & bad al men call y• men of y• londe Englysshmen.
19733,Than after that the Danes pursued the londe aboute a. ij .C.
19734,yere / that is to saye / fro y• foresayd Edbartus tyme vnto saynt Ed¦wardes tyme / & made y• fyfth maner of people in y• ylonde / but they fayled after warde.
19735,At the last came Normans vnto duke Willyam & subdued Englysshmen & yet kepe they y• londe / & they made the syxth people in y• ylonde.
19736,But in the fyrst kynge Henryes tyme came many Fle∣mynges & receyued a dwellȳge place for a tyme besyde Maylros in the west syde of Englonde / & made the seuenth people in the ylonde.
19737,Neuertheles by cōmaūde¦ment of the same kynge they were put thens & dryuen to Hauerfordes syde in y• west syde of wales.
19738,¶ R. And so now in Brytayn Danes & Pictes fayle all out / and fyue nacyons dwell therin / that ben Scottes in Albania / that is Scotlonde.
19739,Brytayne in Cambria / y• is Wales / but that Flemynges dwell in / y• is west Wa¦les.
19740,And Normans & Englysshmen ben medled in al y• ylōde / for it is now doubte in storyes how and in what maner they were put away & destroyed out of Bry∣tayn.
19741,Now it is to declare how y• Pictes were destroyed & fayled.
19742,Brytayn was somtyme occupyed with Saxons / & peas was made & stablisshed with y• Pictes / than y• Scottes y• came with the Pictes sawe y• the Pictes were nobler of dedes and better men of armes though they were lesse in nombre than y• Scottes.
19743,Than the Scottes hauynge therof enuy turned to theyr natural trea¦son y• they haue ofte vsed.
19744,For in treason they passe other men / & bē traytours as it were by kynde / for they prayed all the Pictes / & specially the gretest of them to a feest / & wayted theyr tyme whan the Pictes were mery and had well dronke they drewe vp nayles y• helde vp holowe benches vnder the Pictes / & the Pictes vnware sodeynly fell in ouer y• hammes in to a wonderfull pytfall.
19745,Than y• Scot¦tes fell on y• Pictes & slewe them / & lefte none alyue.
19746,And so of two maner people the better warryours were al destroyed But the other that ben y• Scottes whi∣che ben traytours all vnlyke to y• Pictes toke {pro}fyte by that fals treason / for they toke all that londe / and holde it yet vnto this tyme / & call it Scotlōde after theyr owne name.
19747,In kynge Edgarus tyme Kynadius Alpinus sone was duke & ∣der of the Scottes / and warred in Picte londe & destroyed the Pictes.
19748,He warred syxe tymes in Saxon / & toke all y• londe that is bytwene Twede & y• Scottysshe see with wronge & with strength.
19749,¶ Of the lāguages / of maners & vsage of the people of that londe.
19750,AS it is knowen how many ma∣ner of people ben in this ylonde there ben also so many languages and tongues.
19751,Neuertheles Wn and Scottes that ben not medled with other nacyons kepe yet theyr language & spe∣che.
19752,But yet y• Scottes that were som∣tyme confederate and dwelled with Pi∣ctes drawe somwhat after theyr speche.
19753,But the Flemynges y• dwell in the west syde of Wales haue lefte theyr straunge speche & speke lyke to saxons.
19754,Also Eng∣lysshmen though they had fro y• begyn∣nynge thre maner of speches / southerne northerne / & myddle speche in y• myddle of the londe / as they come of thre maner of people of Germania.
19755,Neuertheles by cōmixcyon & medlynge fyrst wt Danes & afterward wt Normans / in many thyn∣ges y• coūtree language is appayred / for some vse straūge wlaffynge / chyteryng harryng / garryng & grysbytyng.
19756,This appayring of y• language cometh of two thynges.
19757,One bycause y• children y• go to scole lerne to speke fyrst englysshe / & thā ben compelled to cōstrue theyr lessons in frensshe / & that hath bē vsed syth y• Nor∣mans came in to Englonde.
19758,Also gentyl¦mens children ben lerned & taught from theyr youth to speke Frensshe / & vplon∣disshmen wyll coūterfeyte & lyken them selfe to gentylmen / and are besy to speke frensshe for to be more set by / wherfore it is sayd by a comyn {pro}uerbe.
19759,Iacke wold be a gentylmā yf he coude speke frensshe ¶ Treuisa.
19760,This was moche vsed to∣fore the grete deth / but syth it is somdele chaunged / for syr Iohn Cornewayle a mayster of grāmer chaūged y• techynge of grāmer scole & cōstruccyon of frensshe in to englysshe.
19761,And other scole maysters vse y• same waye now / in the yere of our lord.
19762,yere of king Rychard y• seconde / & leue all frensshe in scoles & vse all construccyon in englysshe wherin they haue auaūtage one waye / that is y• they lerne the sooner theyr grā¦mer / & in an other disauaūtage / for now they lerne no frensshe / nor can none / whi¦che is hurte to them y• shall passe the see.
19763,And also gentylmen haue moche lefte to teche theyr chyldren to speke Frensshe.
19764,¶ R. It semeth a grete wonder y• Eng∣lysshmen haue so grete diuersite in theyr owne language in sowne & in speking of it / whiche is all in one ylonde.
19765,And y• lan¦guage of Normandy is comen out of an other londe / & hath one maner sowne a∣monge all other y• speke it in Englonde / for a man of kent / southerne / westerne & northerne men speke frensshe all lyke in sowne & speche / but they can not speke theyr englisshe so.
19766,Neuerthe¦lesse there ben as many diuers maner of frensshe in the realme of Fraūce / as dy∣uers englysshe in y• realme of Englonde.
19767,¶ R. Also of the foresayd tongue whiche is departed in thre is grete wonder / for men of y• eest with men of y• west accorde better in sownynge of theyr speche than men of y• north wt men of y• south.
19768,Ther∣fore it is y• men of merc y• ben of myddle Englonde as it were partyners with y• endes / vnderstande better the syde lan∣guages northerne & southerne than nor¦therne & southerne vnderstande eyther other.
19769,All y• lan∣guage of the northumbres & specially at Yorke is so sharpe shyteynge / froyng & vnshappe / y• we southerne men may vn∣neth vnderstāde y• language.
19770,I suppose the cause be y• they be nigh to y• alyens y• speke straūgely.
19771,Also y• kynges of Eng∣londe abyde & dwell more in y• south coū∣tree thā in y• north coūtree / bycause there is better corne londe / more people / more noble citees / & more {pro}fytable hauens in the south coūtre than in y• north coūtre.
19772,¶ De gentis huius moribus.
19773,FOr y• maners & doynge of walssh men & of Scottes ben tofore som∣what declared.
19774,Now I purpose to tell & declare y• condicyons of y• myddle people of Englonde.
19775,But the Flemynges y• ben in y• west syde of Wales ben now all tur¦ned as they were Englisshmen / bycause they company with Englysshmen.
19776,And they be myghty & stronge to fyght / and ben the moost enemyes that Walshmen haue / and vse marchadyse & clothynge & ben full redy to put themselfe in auen∣tures & to peryll in y• see & londe bycause of grete wynnyng / & ben redy somtyme to the plowe / & somtyme to dedes of ar∣mes whan tyme and place aeth.
19777,It se∣meth of these men a grete wonder y• in a bone of a wethers ryght sholder whan the flesshe is soden away and not rosted they knowe what hath be done / is done and shall be done / as it were by spiryte of propheeye & wonderfull crafte.
19778,They tell what is done in ferre countrees / to∣kens of peas or of warre / the state of the realme / sleynge of men & spousebreche / suche thynges they declare rtayne of tokens & sygnes that is in suche a shol∣der bone.
19779,¶ R. But the Englysshmen y• dwel in Englōde ben medled in y• ylonde and ben ferre from the places that they spronge of fyrst turne to the contrary de∣des lyghtly without entycynge of ony other men by theyr owne assent.
19780,And vn easy also vnpacient of peas / enemyes of besynes / and full of slouth.
19781,de pon .li .iij.
19782,That whan they haue destroyed theyr enemyes all to y• groūde than they fyght with themselfe and slee eche other / as a voyde and an empty sto mak werketh in it selfe.
19783,¶ R. Neuerthe¦lsse men of the south ben easyer & more mylde than men of y• north.
19784,For they be more vnstable / more cruell / and more vn easy.
19785,The myddle men ben parteners wt bothe.
19786,Also they vse them to glotony mo¦re than other men / & ben more costlewe in meet & clothynge.
19787,Men suppose that they toke yt vyce of kynge Hardyknoght that was a Dane.
19788,For he badde set forth wyes double messe at dyner & at souper also.
19789,These men ben spedefull on hors & a fote / able & redy to all maner dedes of s / & ben wont to haue vyctory and maystry in euery fyght where no trea∣son is walkyng / and ben curyous & can well tell dedes & wōders that they haue seen.
19790,And they go in dyuers londes / vn∣neth ben ony men ryche in theyr owne londe or more gracyous in ferre and in straūge londe / they can better wynne & gete newe than kepe theyr owne hery∣tage.
19791,Therfore it is that they be spradde so wyde / & wene y• euery londe is theyr owne.
19792,The men ben able to all maner of sleyght & wytte / but tofore y• dede blon∣derynge & hasty / & more wyse after the dede than tofore / & leue of lyghtly what they haue begon.
19793,¶ Solin{us} li .vj.
19794,Ther¦fore Eugenius the pope sayd / that Eng∣lysshmē were able to do what euer they wolde / & to be set & put tofore all other / ne were yt lyght wytte letteth.
19795,And as Hanyball sayd that y• Romayns myght not be ouercomē but in theyr own coūtre so Englysshmen may not be ouercomē in straūge londes / but in theyr owne coūtre they be lyghtly ouercomen.
19796,¶ R. These men despyse theyr owne & prayse other men / & vnneth be pleased wt theyr owne estate / what befalleth other men yt they wyll gladly take to themselfe.
19797,Therfore it is yt a yeman arayeth him as a squyer a squyer as a knyght / a knight as a du∣ke / a duke as a kyng.
19798,Yet some go about & wyll be lyke to all maner state & be ī no state / for they take euery degre yt be of no degre / for ī beryng outward they be min strels & herawdes / in talkyng grete spe∣kers / in etyng & drȳkyng glotons / in ga¦deryng of catell hucksters & tauerners / in araye turmentours / in wynnynges Argi / in trauayle Tanali / in takynge hede Dedali / ī beddes Sardanapali / in chirches mawmets / in courtes thondre onely / in {per}uylege of clergy & in prebēdes they knowlege themself clerkes.
19799,As touchyng y• termes of latyn / as Argi / Tātali / Dedali / Sardinapali / ye must vnderstande them as y• poetes fey∣ned of them.
19800,Argus was an herde and kepte beestes / he had an hondred eyen / & Argus was also a shyppe / a shipman / & a chapman / & so Argus myght se before and behynde & on euery syde.
19801,Therfore he that is wyse & ware & can se that he be not deceyued / may be called Argus.
19802,And so the cronycle sayth in plurell nom¦bre y• Englysshmen ben Argi / that is to saye / they se about where as wynnyng is.
19803,That other worde Tantali / the poete feyneth that Tantalus slewe his owne sone / wherfore he is dampned to perpe∣tuall penaūce / and he standeth alwaye in water vp to the nether lyppe / & hath alwaye rype apples & noble fruyte han¦gynge downe to the ouer lyppe.
19804,But the fruyte nor the water may not come wtin his mouth.
19805,He is so holden & stādeth by∣twene meet & drynke / and may neyther ete nor drynke / & is euer an hongred and a thyrst / that woo is hym alyue by this maner lykenes of Tantalus / they that do right nought there as is moche to do in euery syde ben called Tantali.
19806,It se∣meth that it is to say in trauayle they be Tantali / for they do ryght nought ther∣to.
19807,The thyrde worde is Dedali / take hede that Dedalus was a subtyll and a slye man.
19808,And therfore by lykenes they that ben subtyll and slye / they ben called Dedali.
19809,And the fourth worde is Sar∣danapali / ye shall vnderstāde yt Sarda∣napalus was kynge of Assyryens / and was full vnchaste / & vsed hym for to lye softe.
19810,And by a maner of lykenes of hym they that lyue vnchastly bē called Sar∣danapali.
19811,¶ R. But amōge all Englyssh¦men medled togyders is so grete a chaū¦gynge & diuersite of clothynge & of aray and so many maners & dyuers shappes that well nygh is there ony mā knowen by his clothynge and his araye of what someuer degree that he be.
19812,Therof pro∣phecyed an holy Anker in ynge Egel∣fredes tyme in this maner.
19813,Englysshmen for as moche as they vse them to dronklewnes / to treason / & to re¦chelesnes of goddes ous / fyrst by Da∣nes / & than by Normans / & at y• thyrde tyme by y• Scottes that they holde the moost wretchest and leest worth of all other they shall be ouercomē.
19814,Than the worlde shall be so vnstable & so duers & varyable that y• vnstablenes of though∣tes shall be betokened by many maner dyuersytees of clothynge.
19815,¶ Here foloweth the descripcyon of the londe of Wales.

19870,HIbernia that is Irlōde / & was of olde tyme incorperate in to y• lord∣ship of Britayn / so sayth Gir.
19871,where he descryueth it at full / yet is it worthy & semeth to prayse that londe wt large praysyng / for to come to clere & full knowlege of y• londe these tytles y• folow open the waye.
19872,Therfore I shall tell of y• place & stede of y• lond how grete & what maner londe it is / wherof y• londe hath plente / and wherof it hath defaute / also what men haue dwelled therin fyrst / of maners of men of that londe / of y• won∣ders of that londe / and of worthynes of halowes & sayntes of that londe.
19873,¶ Of the boūdyng of Irlonde.
19874,xxiij IRlonde is the last of all y• west ylon¦des & hyght Hibernia of one Hibe∣rus of Spayne y• was Hermonius bro∣der / for these two bretherne gate & wan that londe by conquest.
19875,Or it is called Hi¦bernia of y• ryuer Hiberus y• is in y• west ende of Spayne / & y• londe hyght Scot∣lōde also / for Scottes dwelled there som tyme or they came in to y• other Scotlōde that longed to Brytayne / therfore it is wryten in y• Martyloge.
19876,Suche a daye in Scotlonde saynt Bryde was borne / & that was in Irlonde.
19877,This lōde hath in the southeest syde Spayne thre dayes saylynge thens a syde halfe / & hath in y• eest syde y• more Brytayn / thens a days saylynge / in the west syde y• endles Oc∣cean / and in the north syde Yselonde thre dayes faylyng thens.

19879,¶ Of the gretenes and qualite of that londe.

19883,iourneys / & Irlonde is narower in y• myddle than in the endes / all otherwyse than Brytayn is / as Irlonde is shorter north ward than Britayn / so is it longer south ward / the londe is not playne / but full of moūtaynes / of hylles / of wodes / of marays / & of mores / the londe is softe rayny / wyndy / & lowe by y• see syde / & wt∣in hylly & sondy.
19884,There is grete plente of noble pasture and of leese therfore y• beestes must be ofte dryuē out of theyr pasture lest they te ouer moche for they sholde shende themselfe yf they myght ete at theyr wyll.
19885,Men of that londe haue comynly theyr helth / & straūgers haue oft a perylous / by cause of y• moisture of y• meet.
19886,The flesshe of kyen is there holsom / & swynes flesshe vnholsom.
19887,Men of y• londe haue no feuer but onely y• feuer ague / and that ryght selde.
19888,Therfore the holsomnes of y• londe & the clennes out of venym is worth all the boost & richesse of trees / of herbes / of spycery / of ryche clothes / & of precyous stones of the eest londes.
19889,The cause of y• helth & holsomnes of y• londe is y• attem∣perate hete & colde that is therin.
19890,In∣bus reb{us} sufficit.
19891,In this londe ben mo kyen than oxen / more pasture than corne more grasse than seed / there is plente of samon / of lamprays / of eles / & of other see fysshe.

19894,Men of rely∣gyon ete barnacles vpon fastyng dares bycause they be not engendred wt flesshe wherin as me thȳketh they erre / for a¦son is agaynst y• / for yf a man had eten of Adās legge he had etē flesshe / & yet Adā was not engendred of fader nor moder / but y• flesshe cometh wondersly of y• tree.
19895,In this lōde is plente of hony & of mylke of vine & of vyneyerdes.
19896,¶ Solin{us} & ysd wryte y• Irlōde hath no bees.

19898,¶ Bea sayth y• there is grete hūtyng to roobuckes / & it is knowen y• there be none.
19899,It is no won¦der of Beda / for he neuer sawe y• londe / but some man tolde hȳ suche tales.
19900,Also there groweth that stone Saxagon{us} / & is called Iris also / as it were the rayne bowe / yf that stone be holden agaynst y• sonne / anone it shall shape a raynbowe.
19901,There is also founden a stone y• is called Gagathes / & whyte margery perles.
19902,¶ Of the defaute of the londe.
19903,Hete cornes ben there full small vnneth clensed wt mānes hande reserued mē / all beestes bē smaller there than in other lōdes.
19904,There lacketh well nygh al maner fresshe water fysshe y• is not gendred in the see.

19906,There lacketh also Roo & Bucke / & Ilespyles / wontes / and other venymous beestes.
19907,Therfore some men feyne & that fauou∣rably y• saynt Patryck clensed y• londe of wormes & of venymous beestes.
19908,But it is more probable & skylfull y• this londe was from y• begynnynge alwaye wtout suche wormes / for venymous beestes & wormes dye there anone yf men brynge them thyder out of other lōdes.
19909,Also ve∣nym and poyson brought thyder out of other londes / lese theyr malyce as soone as it passeth the myddle of the see.
19910,Also poudre & erth of that londe cast & sowen in other londes dryue away wormes / so ferforth that yf a turfe of y• londe be put about a worme it sleeth hym or maketh hym thryll that erth for to escape away.
19911,In that londe cockes crowe but lytell to∣fore daye / so that the fyrst crowynge of cockes in that londe & the thirde in other londes ben lyke ferre tofore the daye.
19912,¶ Of them that fyrst enhabyted Irlonde.

19948,And Irysshmen speke of Turge{us} & knowe not of Gurmūdus.

19961,¶ Of the condycyons and maners of Irlonde.
19962,SOlinus sayth yt men of this londe ben straunge of nacyon / houseles and grete fighters / and account ryght & wronge all one thynge / & ben syngle of clothynge / scarse of meet / cruell of herte / angry of speche / & drinketh fyrst blode of deed men that ben slayne / & than wasshe theyr visages therwith / and holde them payed with flesshe and fruyte in stede of meet / & with mylke in stede of drynke / & vse moche playenge & ydlenes and hun∣tynge / and trauayle but lytell.
19963,In theyr chyldhode they ben harde nourysshed & harde fedde / & they ben vnsemely of ma∣ners & of clothynge / & haue breche & ho∣sen alone of wolle / & strayte hodes that stretcheth a cubyte ouer the sholders be∣hynde / and foldȳges in stede of mantels & of clokes.
19964,Also they vse no sadels / boo∣tes ne spurres whan they ryde / but they dryue theyr horses wt a chambred yerde in the ouer ende.
19965,In stede of byttes with trenches and of brydels of reest / they vse brydels that lette not theyr horses to ete theyr meet / they fyght vnarmed naked in body / neuertheles with two dartes & speres / and with brode sparthes they fyght wt one hande.
19966,These men forsake tyllynge of londe / and kepe pasture for beestes.
19967,They vse longe berdes & longe lockes hangynge downe behynde theyr hedes / they vse no crafte of flaxe / of woll of metall / nor of marchaūdyse / but gyue them to ydlenes & to slouth / & reken rest for lykynge / and for fredome for rychesse And though Scotlonde the doughter of Irlonde vse harpe / tymbre / and tabour.
19968,Neuertheles Irysshe men be connynge in two maner instrumentes of musyke / in harpe and tymbre yt is armed wt wyre and strenges of brasse / on whiche instru¦mentes though they playe hastely and swyftly they make ryght mery armony & melody with thycke tewnes / werbles and notes / and begyn from bemoll / and playe secretly vnder dyme sowne on the grete strenges / and turne agayne vnto the same / so that the gretest party of the crafte hydeth the craft as it wolde seme as though the crafte so hydde sholde be ashamed yf it were take.
19969,These men ben of euyll maners in theyr lyuynge / they paye no tythynges / they wedde lawful∣ly / they spare not theyr alyes / but y• bro∣der weddeth the broders wyfe / they ben besy to betraye theyr neyghbours / and other they bere sparthes in theyr hādes in stede of staues / & fyght agaynst them that trust moost to them / these men ben varyable & vnstedfast / trechours & gyle∣full / who that deleth with them nedeth more to beware of gyle than of crafte / of peas than of brēnynge brondes / of hony than of gall / of malyce than of knyght∣hode / they haue suche maners yt they be not strōge in warre & in batayle / ne true in peas / they become gosseps to them yt they wyll falsly betraye in ye gosseprede & holy kynrede / eueryche drynketh others blode whan it is shedde / they loue som∣dele theyr nouryce and theyr playferes whiche that souke ye same mylke yt they souked whā they were chyldren / & they pursue theyr bretherne / theyr cosyns / & theyr other kynne / & despise theyr kynne whyles they lyue / & auenge theyr deth whan they ben slayne.
19970,So longe hath y• vsage of euyll custome endured amonge them / that it hath goten ye maystry ouer them / & turneth treason in to kynde / so ferforth yt they ben traytours by nature.
19971,And alyens and men of straūge londes yt dwell amōge them folowynge theyr ma¦ners that vnneth there is none but he is besmetted wt theyr treason also.
19972,Amon∣ge them many men pysse syttynge / and women standynge.
19973,¶ There ben many men in that londe foule shapen in lym∣mes & in body / for in theyr lymmes they lacke the benefyce of kynde.
19974,So that no where better shapen than they that ben there wel shapen worse shapen thā they y• ben yll shapen.
19975,And skylfully nature hurt & defouled by wyt of lyuynge bryngeth suche foul groes & euyll shape of them that wt vn full deynge wt foule maners & euyll lyuyng so wyckedly defouleth kynde & .
19976,¶ In this londe & in Wales olde wyues & women were wonte & ben yet as men saye ofte for to shape themself in lykenes of hares to mylke theyr neygh∣bours kyen & stele theyr mylke / and ofte greyhoūdes tenne after them & pursue them / & wene that they he hares.
19977,And some by crafte of nygromācy make fatte swyne for to be reed of colour / & sell them in markettes & fayres.
19978,But as soone as these swyne passe ony water they turne in to theyr owne kynde / whether it be strawe / hey / grasse / or turues.
19979,But these swyne may not be kepte by no crafte for to endute in lykenes of swyne ouer thre days.
19980,Amōge these wōdets & other take hede that in y• vttermest ende of y• world falleth newe meruayles & wonders / as though kȳde played wt large loue secret∣ly & ferre in y• endes / than openly nygh in the myddel / therfore in this ylonde be many grysely wonders & meruayles.
19981,¶ Of the meruayles and wonders of Irlonde.
19982,MAny men tell that in y• north syde of Irlonde is y• londe of lyfe.
19983,In that ylonde no man may dye / but whan they be olde & vexed with grete sekenes they be borne out in to the nexte londe / & there dye.
19984,¶ There is another ylonde in Irlonde y• no woman therin may ee a chylde / but yet she may cōceyue.
19985,¶ Also there is an ylonde in whiche no deed bo∣dy may rotte.
19986,In Vltonia y• is Ʋlster is an ylde that a uke wonderly departeth in twayne.
19987,In y• one parte is grete distur baunce discomforte of frdes / & in that other party grete lykynge & comforte of holy aungels.
19988,There is also sayne Pa∣trykes purgatory / that was shewed at his prayer to conferme his prechynge & his ore whan he preched to mysbyleued men of sorowe & payne y• euyll men shold suffre for theyr euyll werkes / & of ioye & of blysse that good men shall receyue for theyr holy dedes.
19989,He telleth that who y• suffreth y• paynes of purgatory (yf it be enioyned hym for penaūce) he shal neuer suffre the paynes of hell / but he dye fy∣nally wtout tepentaūce of synne / as ye en∣sample is set more ful at the ende of this chapte.
19990,But truly no man may be saued but yf he be very repētaūt what someuer penaunce he do / & euery man that is very repentaūt at his lyues ende shal be sekerly saued / though he ne∣uer here of saynt Patrykes purgatory.
19991,There is an ylonde in Connacte Sa / y• is in y• see of Conaccina halowed by saȳ Brandon / y• hath no myce / there deed bo¦dyes ben not buryed / but bē kepte out of the erth & rotte not.
19992,In Mamoma is a welle / who y• wassheth hym wt the wa∣terof y• welle / he shall were hoore on his heed.
19993,There is an other well in Vltonia who someuer is wasshen therin he shall neuer wexe hoore afterwarde.
19994,There is a welle in Moūstre or Mamoma / yf ny man touche y• well / anone shall fall grete rayne in all that prouynce / & that rayne shall neuer cesse tyll a preest y• is a ne mayden synge a masse in a chapell that is fast by & blysse y• water / & with mylke of a that is of one yere besprynge y• welle / and so reconcyle the welle in this straunge maner.
19995,At Glyndalan aboute the oratory of saynt Keywyn wytches bere apples as it were apple trees / and ben more holsome than sauery.
19996,That ho¦ly sayne brought forth these apples by prayers for to his childe y• was seke There is a lake in Ʋlster & moche fysshe therin whiche is .xxx.
19997,myle in length / & xv.
19998,The ryuer Ban renneth out of that lake in to y• north Occean / & men saye that this lake began in this maner.
19999,There were men in yt countree yt were of euyll lyuynge (coeuntes cū Brutis) And there was a welle in y• londe in grete re∣uerence of olde tyme / & alwaye couered / yf it were lefte vncouered / the well wold ryse & drowne all y• londe.
20000,And so it hap∣ped that a woman went to yt welle for to fetche water: & hyed her fast to her childe that wepte in the cradell / & lefte y• welle vncouered / than ye welle sprange so fast that it drowned ye woman & her chylde / and made all the coūtree a lake & a fysshe ponde.
20001,For to preue ye this is sothe it is a grete argument / that whan ye weder is clere / fysshers of yt water se in y• grounde vnder the water rounde toures & hygh shapen as steples & chirches of y• londe.
20002,In the north syde of Irlonde in the coū∣tree of Ossyryens euery .vij.
20003,yere at the prayer of an holy abbot / twayne that bē wedded a man & a woman must nedes be exyled and forshapen in to lykenes of wolues / & abyde out .vij.
20004,And at y• ende of .vij.
20005,yere yf they lyue they come home agayne & take agayn theyr owne shape / and than shall other twayne go forth in theyr stede / and so forshapen for other .vij.
20006,There is a lake in this londe / yf a poole of tree pyght & stycked therin / that parte of the shafte or poole yt is in the erth shall turne in to yren / and that parte y• abydeth in the water shall turne in to stone / and that parte that a∣bydeth aboue shall be tree in his owne kynde.
20007,Also there is a lake that turneth hsell in to asshe / and asshe in to hasel / yf it be done therin.
20008,Also in Irlonde bē thre lepes / there as samons lepe a∣st a roche a longe speres lengthe.
20009,Leg is a pond there ben seen Colmans byrdes / the byrdes called Certelles / and come homely to hande / but yf men do them wroug or harme / they go away & come not agayn and the water there shall be bytter and stynke / & he that dyd y• wronge shall not astert without wreche & myschefe / but yf he do amendes.
20010,As touchynge saynt Patrykes purgatory / ye shall vn∣derstande that y• seconde saynt Patryke that was abbot & not bysshop whyle he preched in Irlonde / laboured & studyen for to turne thylke wycked men y• lyued as beestes out of theyr euyl lyfe for drede of y• paynes of hll / & for to cōferme them to good lyf.
20011,And they sayd they wold not turne but some of them myght knowe som what of the grete paynes & also of y• blysse that he spake of.
20012,Than saynt Pa∣tryke prayed to almyghty god therfore / & our lord Iesu Chryst appered to saynt Patryke / & toke hym a staffe & ladde hȳ in to a wylde place & shewed hym there a rounde pyt y• was derke within & sayd / that yf a man were very repentaūt & sta¦ble in byleue & went in to this pyt & wal¦ked therin a daye & a nyght / he sholde se the sorowes & the paynes of euyl men / & the Ioye and blysse of good men.
20013,Than Chryst vanisshed out of Patrikes syght And saynt Patryke arered and buylded there a chirche / and put therin chanons reguler / & closed the pyt aboute with a wall / & is now in the chirche yerde at the eest ende of the chirche / & fast shette with a stronge dore / for no man sholde nycely go in without leue of the bysshop / or of the pryour of y• place.
20014,Many men went in and came out agayne in saynt Patry¦kes tyme / & tolde of paynes & Ioye that they had seen / and the meruayles that they sawe ben there yet wryten / and by∣cause therof many men turned & were conuerted to ryght byleue.
20015,Also many men went in & came neuer out agayne.
20016,In kyng Stephens tyme kyng of Eng¦londe / a knyght y• hyght Owayne went in to saynt Patrykes purgatory & came agayn / & dwelled euer after duryng his lyfe in the nedes of the abbey of Luden∣sis that is of y• ordre of Cysteaux / & tolde many wonders that he had seen in Pa∣trykes purgatory.
20017,That place is called Patrykes purgatory / and the chirche is named Reglis.
20018,No man is enioyned for to go in to that purgatory / but coūseyled that he sholde not come therin / but take vpon hym other penaūce.
20019,And yf a man haue auoided & be saable and wyl nedes go therin / he shall fyrst go to the bysshop and than he shall be sent with lettres to the pryoue of y• place / & they bothe shall coūseyle hym to leue.
20020,And yf he wyll ne∣des go therto / he shall be in prayers & in fastynge .xv.
20021,dayes / and after .xv.
20022,dayes he shall be houseled & ladde to the dore of the purgatory with processyon & letany and yet he shall be coūseyled to leue it / & yf he be stedfast and wyll ene / the dore shall be opened & he blyssed & go in god∣des name / & holde forth his waye / and the dore shall be fast shette tyll the nexte daye / and whan the tyme is the pryour shall come and open the dore / and yf the man be comen he ledeth hym in to y• chir¦che with {pro}cessyon / and there he shall be xv.
20023,dayes in prayers and fastynge.
20024,¶ Of the meruayles of sayntes of Irlonde.
20025,HEre Girald{us} maketh mynde that as men of this nacyon ben more angry than other men / & more hasty for to take wreche whyles they ben alyue / so sayntes & halowes of this londe ben more wrechefull than sayntes of other londes.
20026,Clerkes of this londe ben chaste and saye many prayers / & done grete ab¦stynence a daye / & drynke al nyght / so is accoūted for a myracle y• ery th not there as wyne regneth / and ben cha¦sen out of abbeys in to the clergy / & done as monkes sholde.
20027,But they y• ben yll of them ben worste of all other.
20028,So good men amonge them though they ben but fewe ben good at ye best.
20029,Prelates of that countree ben full owe in cor o trespace / and besy in cōtemplacyon / and not in prechyng of goddes worde.
20030,Ther¦fore it is that all y• sayntes of that londe ben cōfessours and no martyrs amonge them / & no wonder / for al the prelates of this londe clerkes and prelates sholde do is to them vnknowen.
20031,Therfore whā was put agaynst the bysshop of Cassyll how it myght be that so many sayntes ben in Irlonde & neuer a martyr amōge them all / sythen y• the men bē so shrewed and so angry / & the prelates so recheles and slowe in coreccyon of trespace.
20032,The bysshop answered frowardly ynough & sayd.
20033,Our men ben shrewed and angry ynough to themselfe / but to goddes ser∣uaūtes they ley neuer hāde / but do them grete reuerence & worshyp / but englyssh men come in to this londe that can make martyrs / & were wont to vse that crafte ¶ .
20034,The bisshop sayd so bycause y• kyng Henry the seconde was tho newe comen in to Irlonde fresshely after the marty dome of saynt Thomas of Caūterbury.
20035,In this londe / in wales & in londe ben belles and staues with croked hedes / & other suche thȳges for retykes in grete reuerence & worship / so y• men of this londe drede more for to swere vpon one of those belles & golden staues than vpon the gospels.
20036,The chefe of all suche relykes is holden Iesus staffe that is a Deuelyn / with y• whiche staffe they say that y• fyrst saynt Patryke droue y• wor∣mes out of Irlond.
20037,yf men ae how it may be y• dyuers maner of beestes & of dyuers kynde that kyndly goten bytwene male & female come ben in ylondes after Noes flode.
20038,Men suppose that suche beestes wāme in to ylondes about / & fyrst to the nexte and o forth in to other.
20039,Or els men say∣lynge in to ylondes brought with them suche beestes for loue of huntynge.
20040,Or aungels at god almyghtyes camaunde mēt brought suche beestes in to ylondes aboute / or the erth brought them forth fyrst / and fulfylled tho goddes cōmaun∣dement / that cōmaūded y• erth to brynge forth grasse and quycke beestes.
20041,¶ Here endeth the descripcyon of Bry∣tayne / the whiche conteyneth Englonde Wales and Scotlond / and also bycause Irloude is vnder the ule of Englonde / & of olde tyme it ath so contynued / ther fore I haue set the descripcyon of y• same after the sayd Brytayn / whiche I haue taken out of cronycon.
20042,And bycause it is necessary vnto all Englysshemen to knowe y• propertees / modytees & mer∣uayles of them / I illyā Caxton haue set them fyrst in imprynt accordynge to the translacyon of Treuisa / whiche at y• request of the lorde Barkeley trāslated y• boke of Polyeronycon in to Englysshe.

20060,"MANY are the dombe warninges of Distruction, which the Almighty God hath lately scourged this our King∣dome with; And many more are the threatning Tokens, of his heauy wrath extended toward vs: All which in blee∣ding hearts, may inforce vs to put on the true garment of Repentance, and like vnto the Niniuits, vnfainedly solicite the sweet mercies of our most louing God: Therefore let vs now call to remem∣brance the late grieuous and most lamentable Plague of Pestilence, wherein the wrath of God tooke from vs so many thousandes of our friendes, kindred and ac∣quaintance: let vs also call to remembraunce the most wicked and pretended malice, of the late Papisticall Conspiracie of Traytors, that with powder practised the subuersion of this beautifull Kingdome: And lastly let vs fir our eyes vpon theise late swellinges of the outragious Waters, which of late now hapned in diuers partes of this Realme, together with the ouer∣flowing of the Seas in diuers and sundry places there∣of: whose fruitfull valeys, being now ouerwhelmed and drowned with these most vnfortunate and vnseasona∣ble salt waters, doe fore-shew great Barrennes, and Famin to ensue after it, (vnlesse the Almightie God of tis great infinit mercy and goodnesse doe preuent it.)"
20061,"But now oh England, be not ouercome with thine owne fully: Be not blinded with the ouermuch secu∣ritie of thy selfe, neyther sinke thou thy selfe in thine owne sinne: the generall dissolution of the whole world by in the time of Nov, neuer the like Inundation or watry punishment then hapned now here related to the great griete of all Christian hea∣rers, as by this shall heare appeare."
20062,"Upon Tuesday being the 20. of Ianuary last past, 1607 in diuers places aswell in the Westerne partes of England, as also in places of this Realme: there hapned such an ouerflowing of Waters, such a violent swelling of the Seas, and such forcible breathes made into the firme Land: namely into the bosomes of these countrie following."
20063,"That is to say, in the Counties of Glocester, Sommer et, together with the Countries of Monmoth, Glamorgan, Carmarthen, and diuers and sundry other places of South-wales: the like neuer in the memory of man, hath euer bin soeue or beard of: The suddayne terror whereof strooke such an amazed feare into the hearts of all the inhabitants, of those partes, that euery one prepared himselfe ready to entertayne the last Period of his liues Destruction: Doeming it altogether to be a second deluge: or an vni∣uersal, punishment by Water."
20064,"For vpon the Tuesday being the 20 of Ianuary last, as atoresaid, about nine of the clocke in the morning, the Sunne being most fayrely and brightly spred, many of the Inhabitantes of those Countreys before menci∣oned, prepared the mlues to their affayres, some to one buisines, some to an other: euery man according to his calling."
20065,"As the Plowmen setting foorth their Cattle to their labours, the Shepheardes feeding of their flockes, the Farmers ouer▪seeing of their grounds, and looking so their cattle finding therein, and so euery one imploid in his busines as occasion required."
20066,"Then they might see & perceiue a far of, as it were in the Ele∣ment, huge and mighty Hilles of water, tumbling one ouer another, in such sort as if the greatest mountaines, in the world, had ouer-whelmed the lowe Ualeyes or Marshy grounds."
20067,"Sometimes it so dazled the eyes of many of the Spectators, that they immagined it had bin some fogge or miste, comming with great swiftnes towardes them: and with such a smoke, as if Moun∣taynes were all on fire: and to the view of some, it seemed as it: of thousandes of Arrowes had bin shot foorth all at one time, which came in such swift∣nes, as it was verify thought, that the Fowles of the ayre could scarse fly so fast, such was the threatning fu∣ryes thereof."
20068,"But assoone as the people of those Countries, percei∣ued that it was the violence of the Waters of the ra∣ging Seas, and that they began to exceede the compasse of their accustomed boundes, and making so furiously towardes them."
20069,"happy were they that could make the best, and most speed away, many of them, leauing all their goods and substance, to the merciles Waters, be∣ing glad to escape away with life themselues: But so violent and swift were the outragioue waues, that pur∣sued one an other, with such vehemencie, and the Wa∣ters multiplying so much in so short a time, that in lesse then fiue houres space▪ most part of those cuntreys (and especially the places which lay lowe,) were all o∣uer flowen, and many hundreds of people both men wo∣men, and children were then quite deuoured, by these outragious waters, such was the furie of the waues, of the Seas, the one of them dryuing the other for∣wardes with such force and swiftnes, that it is almost incredible for any to beleeue the same, except such as tasted of the smart thereof, and such as behelde the same, with their eyes: Nay more, the Farmers, Hus∣bandmen, and Shepheards, might beholde their goodly flockes of Sheepe, swimming vpon the Waters dead, which could by no meanes be recouered."
20070,"Many Gentlemen, Yeomen and others, had great losses, of cattle, as Oxen, Kine, Bullockes, Horses, Colts, Sheepe, Swine, Nay not so much as their poul∣try about their houses, but all were ouer whelmed and drownd, by these merciles Waters: Many men that were rich in the morning when they rose out of their beds, were made poore before noone the saine day: such are the Judgements of the Almightie God, who is the geuer of all good thinges, who can and will dispose of them agayne at all times, according to his good will and pleasure, whensoeuer it shall seeme best vnto him."
20071,"Many others like wise, had their habitations or dwel∣ling houses all carryed away in a short time, and had not a place left them, so much as to shrowde them∣selues in."
20072,"Moreouer, many that had great store of Corne and Grayne, in their Barnes and Garners in the morning had not within fiue boures space afterwardes, so much as one Grayne to make them bread withall: Neither had they so much left as a locke of Hay or Straw to seede their cattell which were left: Such was the great misery they susseyned by the fury of this wa∣try Element, from which like, good Lord I beseech him of his influ e mercy and goodnes to deliuer vs all."
20073,"The names of some of the Townes and Uillages which suffered great harmes and losses hereby were these, (Viz.)"
20074,"Bristoll and Aust this Aust is a village or town some 8. miles distant from Bristoll vpon the Seauerne side where all people are Fer∣ryed ouer, that come out of Wales, into those partes of Gloucester and Sommersect-shire."
20075,"All the countries along on both the sides of the ri∣uer of Seauerne, from Gloucester to Bristoll, which is a∣bout some 20. miles was all ouer flowne, in some places 6. miles ouer, in some places more, in some lesse."
20076,"Moreouer, all or the most parte, of the Bridges, be∣tweene Gloucester and Bristoll, were all forcibly caried away with the Waters: besides many goodly buildings there abouts much defaced, and many of them carryed quite away: besides many other great losses of al kinds of Corne and Grayne, and cattle that were then lost."
20077,"At Aust, many passengers that are Ferryed ouer there now, are saine to be guided by guides, all along the Canes, where the water still remayneth for the space of 3 or 4 myles, or else they wilbe, in great daun∣ger of Drowning, the Water lyeth as yet so deepe there."
20078,"Many dead Carkasses, both there, and in many o∣ther places, of the country, are dayly found floating vpon the Waters, and as yet cannot be knowne who they are, or what number of persons are drowned, by reason of the same Waters, which as yet in many places remaine very deepe: so great was the spoyle that thiese mercilesse Elementes there wrought and made."
20079,"In Bristoll was much harme done, by the ouerflow∣ing of the Waters, but not so much as in other places, many Cellars and Ware-houses, where great store of Marchandize was in, (as Wine, Salt, hops, Spices, and other such like Ware) were all spoyled."
20080,"And the people of the Towne were inforced to be carried in Boates, vp and downe the said Cittie about their busines in the Fayre time there."
20081,"Upon the other side of the Riuer of Seauerne, to∣wardes a Towne called Chepstow, vpon the lower groundes, was much harme done, by the vyolence of the Water."
20082,"There was in Chepstow a woman drown'd in her bed: and also a Gyrle, by the like misfortune."
20083,"Also, all along the same coastes."
20084,"vp to Gold-clift, Matherne, Calicot-Moores, Redrift, Newport, Cardiffe, Cowbridge, Swansey, Laugerne, Llanstephan, and di∣uers other places, of  and Cardigan▪shire: many great harmes were there done, and the waters raged so furi∣ously▪ and with such great vehemencie, that it to suppo∣sed that in those partes, there cannot be so few persons drowned as 500: both Men."
20085,"Women, and Children, besides the losse of aboundance of all kinde of Corno and Graine: together with their Hay, and other prouision which they had made for their Cattle."
20086,"Moreouer, there were in the places afore mentioned, many thousandes of Cattle, which were eeding in the Lowe Ualeys, drownd and ouerwhelmed with the vi∣olence of the furious waters: as Oren kine, young beastes, horses, Sheepe, Swine, and such like, the num∣ber is deemed infinit: yea, and not so much as Turkies, Hens, Geese, Duckes, and other Poultry about their houses could once escape away, the Waues of the Sea so ouerwhelmed them."
20087,"And that which is more straunge: There are not now found onely floating vpon the Waters still remai∣ning, the dead Carkasses of many men women and children: But also an aboundance of all kinde of wilde Beasts, as Foxes, Hares, Connies, Rats, Moules and such like: some of them swimming one vpon an others Becke▪ thinking to haue saued themselues thereby▪ but all was in vaine, such was the force of the Waters that ouer▪pressed them."
20088,"In a place in Munmoth shire, there was a maide went to milke her kine in the morning, but before she had fully ended her busines, the vehemencie of the Waters increased, and so suddenly environed her about, that she could not escape thence, but was enforced to make shift vp to the top of an Banke to saue herselfe, which she did with much adoe, where she was constrained to abide all that day and night, vntill 8 of the clocke in the next morning in great distresse, what with the coldnes of the ayre and waters: and what with other Accidents that there hapned vnto her, she had bin like there to haue perished: had not the Almightie God of his infinit mer∣cy and goodnes, preserued her, from such great perills and daungers, which were likely there to ensue vn∣to her."
20089,"But there placing her selfe for saueguard of her life as aforesaid, hauing none other refuge to fly vnto: the Waters in such violent sort had so pursued her, that there was but a small distance of ground left vncouered with Waters, for her to abide vpon: There she re∣mayned most pittyfully lamenting the great daunger of life that she was then in, expecting euery minute of an houre, to be ouerwhelmed with those mercylesse Wa∣ters: But the Almighty God, who is the Creator of all good things, when he thought méete, sent his holy An∣gell to commaund the Waters to cease their fury: and so returne into their accustomed bonuds againe, wher∣by according to his most blessed will and pleasure she was then preserued."
20090,"In the meane space, during the continuance of her abode there, diuers of her friends practised all the means they could to recouer her, but could not, the Waters were of such a déepenes about her, and Boates they had none, in all those partes to succour her, such was their want in this distresse, that many perished through the want thereof."
20091,"There was a Gentleman of worth, dwelling néere vnto the place where she was, who caused a goodly Gelding to be sadled, and set a man vpon the backe of him, thinking to haue fetcht her away, but such were the déepenes of the waters, that he durst not aduenture the same, but retyred."
20092,"At last some of her friends, deuised a deuise, and tyed two broad Troughes the one to the other, (such as in those countreys they vse to salt Bacon in) and put ther∣in two lustie strong men, who with long Powles (stir∣ring these troughes) (as if they had bin boates) made great shift to come to her, & so by this meanes, through Gods good helpe she was then saued."
20093,"But now (gentle Reader) marke what befell, at this time, of the strangenes of other creatures: whom the Waters had violently oppressed: for the two men which tooke vpon them to fetch away the maide from the top of the Banke, can truely witnes the same as well as her selfe to be true, for they beheld the same with their Eyes."
20094,"The Hill or Banke where the maide abode all that space▪ was all so couered ouer, with wilde beastes and vermin, that came thither to séeke for succour) that she had much adoe to saue her selfe, from taking of hurt by them: and much a-doe she had to kéepe them from crée∣ping vpon and about her, she was not so much in daun∣ger of the Water on the one side: as she was troubled with these Uermin on the other side."
20095,The beastes and Uermin that were there were these.
20096,"(Viz) Dogs Cats, Moules, Foxes, Hares, Conyes, yea and not so much, as Mice and Rats: but were there in abundance and that which is more straunge: The one of them neuer once offred to annoy the other: al∣though they were deadly enemies by Nature the one to an other: Yet in this daunger of life, they not once offred to expresse their naturall enuie: But in a gentle sort, they freely inioyed the libertie of life, which in mine opinion, was a most wonderfull worke in Na∣ture."
20097,"But now let vs leaue this matter touching this maide, besides the other accidentes before rehearsed and let vs returne againe to these watry miseries: The counties of Glamorgan."
20098,"Carmarthen, and Cardigan, and many other places in South-wales, haue likewise borne the heauy burden, of Gods wrath herein: And many were the liues of them that were lost through this wa∣tery destruction."
20099,"Many there were which fled into the toys of high trées, and there were inforced to abide some three daies, some more, and some lesse▪ without any victuals at all, there suffring much colde besides many other calami∣ties, and some of them in such sort, that through euer∣much hunger and cold, some of them fell down againe out of the Trées, and so were like to perish for want of succour."
20100,"Othersame, sate in the toys of high Trees as aforesaid, beholding their wiues, children, and seruants, swimming (remediles of all succour) in the Waters."
20101,Other some sitting in the tops of Trees might behold their houses ouerflowne with the waters.
20102,some their houses caryed quite away: and no signe or token left there of them.
20103,"Many of them might sée, as they stood vpon the toys of high Hilles, their cattle pe, and could not tell how to succour them, and their Barnes, with all their store of Corne and Graine quite consumed, which was no small griefe vnto them."
20104,"Many people and Cattle in diuers places of these Cuntreys, might haue beene saued in time, if that the cuntreys had beene any thing like furnished with bootes, or other prouision fit for such a sudden Accident, as this was, which as God himselfe knoweth▪ was little ex∣pected of them to haue fallen so suddenly vpon them."
20105,"But seeing the cuntreys were so vnfurnished with Boates much harme was done, to the vtter vndooing of many thousandes."
20106,"Some fled into the tops of churches and Stéeples, to saue themselues, from whence they might beholde, themselues depriued aswell of all their substance, as al∣so of al their ioys▪ which they had before receiued in their wiues and children, beware, whole Rkes of Pease, Beanes, Dates, and other graine were seene a far of, to float vpon the Water too and fro, in the Countreys as if they had bin ships vpon the Seas."
20107,"The Foundations of many Churches and houses, were in a manner decayed, and some caryed quite a∣way, as in Cardisse, in the county of Glamorgan there was a great part of the Church next the Water side ea∣ten downe, with the Water, many houses and Gar∣dens there, which were neere the water side, were all ouerflowen, and much harme bone."
20108,"Diuers other Churches lie hidden in the Waters, and some of them the tops are to be seene: and other some, nothing at all to be séene, but the very tops of the Steeples, and of some of them nothing at all, neyther steeple nor nothing else."
20109,"Also many schooles of young schollers, in many places of those cuntreys, stood in great perplexitle, some of them aduenturing home to their parents were drowned by the way: Other some staying behinde in in Churches, did climbe vp to the tops of Steeples, where they were very neere starued to death for want of foode and fire: many by the help of boards and plankes of Wood, swam to dryland and so were preserued from vntimely Death, Many had Boates brought them, some 10 miles, some 15. some 20. where there was neuer seene any Boates before."
20110,"Thus God suffred many of them to escape his yrefull wrath, in hope of their amendment of life: Some men that were riding on the high wayes were ouertaken with these mercilesse Waters, and were drowned."
20111,And againe many haue bin most strangely preserued.
20112,"As for example, there was in the Countie of Gla∣morgan▪ a man both blind and did ride and one which had not bin able to stand vpon his legs in ten yeares be∣fore, he had his poore cottage broken downe by the force of the Waters, and himselfe, Bed and all caryed into the open fields, where being readie to sinke, and at the point to seeke a resting place, two fathoms deepe vnder the Waters: his hand by chaunce catcht holde of the Raster of an house swimming by the fiercenesse of the Windes, then blowing Easternely he was driuen safe∣ly to the Land, and so escaped."
20113,"Also in an other place, there was a man Child of the age, of 5. or 6. yeares, which was kept swimming for the space of two houres, abone the Waters, by reason that his long Coates lay spread vpon the tops of the wa∣ters, and béeing at last, at the very poynt to sinke: there came by chaunce by, (floating vpon the tops of the Waters,) a fat Weather that was dead, very full of Wooll: The poore distressed Child perceiuing this good meanes of recouerie, caught fast hold on the Wethers Wool, and likewise with the winde he was driuen to dry land, and so saued."
20114,"There wes also in the County of Carmarthen, a yaung Woman, who had foure small Children, and not one of them able to helpe it selfe: And the Mo∣ther then seeing the sues of the Waters to be so vio∣lent to ceaze vpon her threatning the Destruction of her selfe and her small Children, (and as a Womans wil is euer ready in extreamities) The tooke along Trough, wherein she was wont to make her bread in, and therein placed her selfe, and her foure Children: And so putting themselues to the mercies of the Wa∣ters, they were all by that meanes driuen to the dry land, and by Gods good prouidence there by they were all saued."
20115,"Many more there were that through the handy∣workes of God were preserued from this violent death o Drowning, some on the backes of dead Cattles some vppon Woodden plankes: some by clyming of Trées▪ some by remaining in the tops of high Stée∣ples and Churches, other some by making of spéed a∣way with swift horses, and some by the meanes of Boates, sent out by their friendes to succour them: but there were not so many so straungely saued, but their were as many in number as straungely drownd."
20116,"The lowe Marshes and Fenny groundes, néere Barstable in the Countie of Deuon were ouerflowne, so farre out, and in such outragious sort, that the cuntrey all along to Bridge-water was greatly distre∣ssed thereby, and much hurt there done it is a most pit∣tifull sight to beholde what numbers of fat Oxen, were there Drawned: what flockes of Shéepe, what heades of kine, haue their bin lost, and Drowned in in these outragious Waters: there is little now remai∣ning there, to be séene, but huge Waters like to the maine Ocean: The tops of Churches and Stéeples like to the tops of Rockes in the Sea."
20117,"Great Reekes of Fod∣der for Cattle, are floating like Ships vpon the Wa∣ters, and dead Beastes swimming thereon: Now past feeding on the same, through the rigour of this Element of Water: The tops of Tréees, a man may beholde re∣maining aboue the Waters, Upon whose braunches, multitudes of all kinde of Turkies, Hens, and other such like Poultry were faine to sly vp into the Trées to saue their liues, where many of them perished to death, for want of reliefe, not being able to fly to dry land for succour, by reason of their weakenes."
20118,"This mercylesse Water breaking into the Bosome of the firme Land, hath proued a fearefull pnish∣ment, as well to all other liuing Creatures: as al∣so to all Mankinde: Which if it had not binne for the mercyfull promise of God, at the last dissolution of the World, by Water, by the signe of the Rain∣bowe, which is still shewed vs: we might haue ve∣rily beléeued, this time had bin the very houre of Christ his comming: From which Element of Water, extended towardes vs in this fearefull manner, good Lord deliuer vs all."

20158,"For they lay it to the charge of some of us at the least, that we suspect our King of being perverted in a Superstitious way of Gods worship, as if he intended to bring in some alteration of Religion in our Land, against his sundry publicke Declartions and  (saith he)  Now for our parts, we doe appeale to thy righteous judgement, O searcher of all hearts, whether we have been apt causelessely to suspect or surmise the least evill of our King, but on the contrary, have been ready to interpret all his actions in such a sense, as perswading our selvs, whatever things were amisse in Church or Common-weale, or whatever Innovations brought in, yea although under the name of Royall Authority, yet the King was ignorant of them, and his name therin abused by some bad Officers about him."
20159,"Yea, how unwilling are we to this very day (notwithstanding the late Synod so called and confirmed by the King) to conceive the least sinister thought of him."
20160,"So as we are apt to thinke that those Innovations brought in since and under his Raigne, have either crept in by stealth and by degrees without his know∣ledge, or been craftily suggested as being no Innovations at all, but rather renovations of the decayes of the old Religion (so ulgarly called) being induced thereunto by the ancient use thereof retained in some places of the Land, since the Reforma∣tion, as especially in the Roall Chappels, and Cathedralls, though not confirmed by any Law, as the use of Altars, Images, and the like."
20161,"But now when we see with open eyes to our hearts grief, those things to be concluded as by a Law (Canons of Prelats now being made binding Laws) and so confirmed by the Letter Patents of the King, for him, his Heires, and lawfull Succes∣sors: O Lord, what shall we think?"
20162,"Nay, when we see a strict Oath injoyned and imposed upon all Ministers, of what style, or ranke soever, and upon all graduates in the Universities, &c. to approve, and preserve the Doctrine and Discipline or Govern∣ment, as it  and knowing, that by publick Acts, Edicts, Decres, Declarations, Books, &c."
20163,"(set forth and published in the Kings Name, and patronized by his speciall Authority Royall) the  the Morality of thy holy Commandements, the Doctrines of thy Grace and Gospel, with the preaching thereof; all preaching on thy Dayes in the afternoons, and all true Catechi∣sing, mainly cryed down: and that all thy painfull, and godly Ministers are  and can have no remedy either by course of Law (which is stopped) or by the King himselfe to wom they complaine: and that the Prelates of late more especially usurped a false Title to their false Government Ecclesiasticall by claiming their Pre∣laticall Jurisdiction from thine own divine Authority; So as we cannot be any longer ignoran (except we will be wilfully blind) that the  in Queene Elizabeths dayes, hath now suffered not onely an Inno∣vation, but an utter eversion and extirpation of the very founda∣tions thereof: And this Innovation, this eversion, being now finally concluded on in a Synod, confirmed by the King, and injoyned to be Sworne unto by all those aforesaid: and besides all this, the King himselfe professing, that he hath  and  And thereupon doth  Now ô Lord, all these things weighed and layd together, Solemne and Sacred Protestations against Innovations on the one side, and a mighty flood of Inno∣vations on the other side, which by Royall Authority have made a terrible universall invasion and irruption both into thy Spiri∣tuall Kingdome, and this Temporal, threatning speedily to sweep all away at once: what shall we thinke?"
20164,Or what shall we say?
20165,"Wouldst thou have us still to dreame or imagine, that here are no Innovations at all brought in either of Doctrine, or Ecclesiasti∣call Government, and all because the King hath so frequently, so solemnly before Gd, and Angels and Men, protested to the contrary?"
20166,"Or, that the Innovations concluded in this Synod, are therfore no Innovations, because ratified and confirmed by the Kings Letters Patents, and by all the strength of Royall Authority, and because commended by the King to be such, as  Or may we not rather thinke, or rather most certainly beleeve, that (for the iniquities of the Land) oppression in the State, persecuti∣ons of thy Ministers, effusion of innocent blood of thy Servants, open Profanation of thy Sabbaths, and that by publicke dispensa∣tion, yea in a word, a contemptuous trampling of all Laws di∣vine and humane underfeet; nay yet more (more especially, as the orginall source and cause of all the rest) a damnable Apo∣stacie from the Gospel, joyned with a desperate League with Rome, too palpable to be seen, so as Antichrists Religion is imbra∣ced instead of thy True word and Gospell: for this, for these crying sins, is it not lawfull for us to thinke at least, yea to be∣leeve, that thou in thy just judgement restrained and withheld from us the benigne influence of the Kings heart, and hast so farre (for a time at least, for our humiliation) given him up to be Seduced by the Prelates and their Romish faction, and to be guided and led by their Councels, as refusing to hearken to any true Information of his most loving and loyall Subjects, (whereof we have had of late lamentable experience) he will rather hazard all his Kingdomes, then either displease them, or disobey their Councels?"
20167,"But yet, ô Lord, seeing thy  we will not take upon us to judge in so deep a matter, onely thou hast sayd,  But Lord, the King saith,  Holy and Righteous Lord, hast thou given to any mortall Creature, to any Kings on Earth, any such Prerogative Royall, any such Su∣preme Authority over thy Church, as to alter Religion at his pleasure, or to confirme the alteration of the true Religion for others pleasure, to make voyd by Edicts or Declarations the Saving Doctrines of thy word, thy holy Commandements, thine eternall Law, or to sit in thy Throne, over the Soules and Consciences of thy People, captivating and oppressing them under the bur∣thens of humane inventions, and Superstitious Ceremonies▪ Nay, hast thou not expreslyCol."
20168,8. to the end of the Chapter.
20169,"forbidden thy People to subject their necks under any such yoake, as being a denyall of thee our King, and of our Redemption by thy precious blood▪ Such usurpa∣tions therfore of man, we doe, (ô onely Soveraigne of our soules) even before Angels and men utterly renounce.Esa."
20170,"And, Lord, be thou our Judge between us and our oppressors in this thing, and give thy People holy courage and zeale to use all lawfull meanes for the upholding of this thy Sole Royall Soveraignty over our poor Soules and Consciences, against all Antichristian usurpations to the contrary."
20171,"And last of all, whereas our King saith,  Gods  (which words are taken out of the Act for Confor∣mity in Queen Elizabeths Raigne.)"
20172,"If it shall clearly appeare by this our Complaint following, that the things concluded in the said Synod, be neither for the advancement of Gods glory."
20173,"nor the edifying of his Church, nor the due reverence of Christs holy Mysteries and Sraments, but quite contrary: then, how the Kings Authority extends to the confirmation of those things therein so concluded, do thou, ô Lord, Judge."
20174,"In the next place, we present our Complaint before thee, ô Lord, touching the most materiall Canons concluded by the id Synod, and confirmed by the King."
20175,The first is: Concerning the Regall power.
20176,"or absolute, as all Tyrannicall States, as that of the Turke; seeing the Kingdome of England is empered, seasoned, and conditioned with good Laws, which are the ordinary rules of good and just Government of the Subject, the due execution whereof in the administration of the Kingdome is an essentiall part of the Kingly ffice, which cannot be seperated one from the other."
20177,"To this purpose King Iames in Speach at Speeces in Parliament expresly distinguisheth between an absolute Mo∣narchie, not bounded with Laws, but depending onely on the will of the Prince; and the King of England who (saith he) doth by that by Oath, nter upon the Kingdome to of their Estates: let him but call a Parliament, and yeeld to the redressing of their heavy grievances, and he shall find us his People most ready to  yea abundant, more then necessary."
20178,"Againe, what assurance of true and just right, title and property to, and in all their goods and estates can this their Canon, as it were by Canon-Law, make unto the Subjects of England, when all then practises both in the Ecclesiasticall and Civill Government are such, such the courses of their Courts whether Ecclesiasticall, or mixt, as consisting of Ecclesiasticall and Civil Judges together, but still where the Ecclesiasticall beare the maine Sway, even there, where they be fewest in number) such their usurped, illegall, extravagant power, such terrible Precedents filed up in their Courts, which stand for Laws and ruled Cases, for all that come after; and the like: as no Subject in the Kingdome can secure himselfe, that any one thing, or all that he possesseth, are his owne?"
20179,"For the best and surest Tenure, by which every free∣borne Subject holds the right and propriety of his goods, is the Law of the Land."
20180,"But let the Subject be brought into one of their Ecclsiasticall Courts as aforesaid (whether into their High-Commission, or other Courts where the Arch-prelates sit party Iudges) and be his cause never so just, never so innocent, never so cleare, as against which no Law of the Land doth lye, yet, first of all in those Courts he cannot have any benefit of the Law at all, and consequently, where those Ecclesiasticall Judges set their Fangs, they will teare a man out of all his este, yea out of his Skin, and pull his flesh from his back, and breake him and his all in pieces."
20181,"So as at those Boards, where these harpies sit, against whomsoever complaints are served in, being such especially as whe the Ecclsiasticall teeth against them, how quickly shall they and their whole estates be swallowed up as it were at one morsell?"
20182,"And to the end, that the Civil State may be subservient to the Ecclesiasticke, these Ecclesiasticks have their care in every bte, and their finger in every pye, where any thing may be pluckt from the Subject, by hocke, or by crooke, that so, as their Ecclesiastick Government, is Tyrannicall, so they may advance the Civil to hold correspondence with it: So as now the whole Government taken together, is reduced to certaine Talls, even as all Religion is served up upon a Court-Cubord at the end of the Chancel, wherof anone."
20183,"And (as is noted before, which least it be forgotten, we mention againe) whatever Con∣clusions or Orders are made at those Tables, or Boards, (e they never so foule and shamefull) they are fixed and filed up for per∣petuall Laws in all such cases for time to come; yea and when they please, where they want a Precedent for some extraordi∣nary feat to be done, they can with a wet finger make a new Law for it."
20184,"Hereof if we take but a few instances, it will easily appeare what truth there is in the words of this Canon, which seem to give to the Subject what ever right and title, and true property of estate doth or can belong unto them."
20185,"For, first, we have late Precedents to shew, that no Freeman of London, after he hath served his yeares, and set up his Trade, can be sure long to injoy the Liberty of his Trade, but either he is forbidden longer to use it, or is forced at length with the rest of his trade to purchase it as a Monopolie at a deare rate, which they and all the Kingdome pay for."
20186,Witnesse the Sope-businesse.
20187,"A∣gaine, no Doctor and practitioner in Physicke is sure to hold his Profession, whereby he and his should live, when once he comes into the High Commission."
20188,"Item, no Minister is sure to hold his free-hold, his Benefice (which is by Law his freehold) if once he be quarrelled in the High Commission, yea or in other inferiour Ecclesiasticall Courts."
20189,Witnesse mani∣fold Precedents in the Land.
20190,"Item, none can be sure that his goods are his owne, when all, and more then all are taken from Witnesse Mr Henry Buton, one of the foresaid three."
20191,"Item, none can be sure of his right and title, propriety and interest, which the Divine Law, and Sacred Ordinance of God hath given a man in his own Wife, but that one of these Boards shall him, as by vertue thereof, being confined to perpetuall prison, his Wife shalbe perpetually seperated from him, so as if she shall dare to hazzard her life in a fare ourney by Sea which She would doe) to have but a sight o her Husbands face, she must be sent Prisoner backe againe, Witnesse the case both of Dr Bastwcke, and Mr Burton afore∣said."
20192,Many more instances might be brought.
20193,"But these Sum∣med up together, let any English Subject now resolve, what assurance o true and just ight, title and property to, and in all their goods and estates, or in any of the particular instances forespeci∣fied, this false and wicked Canon can give him?"
20194,"Let him be but brought before one of these Boards, and he shalbe stript of all."
20195,"They will pretend this, and that I wot not what, henous crime, () as they did against those three aforesaid, when they could not prove any such thing."
20196,"And Mr Burtons Case in particular, being a Minister, was so cleare (his defensive Answere being orderly admitted in Court, and before the day of , by the Courts order expanged by two of the Judges o that Court as Impertinent and Scandalous) as they could object nothing against him at the Censure, but proceed against him Pro Confess, all his fault being his refusal to answere Interrogatories, which if he had done, he had betrayed his Cause, and layd both it and himselfe open to the just lash of the Court, by assenting to the condemnation of his innocent Cause, before it was heard."
20197,"Which one Example well weigh∣ed, what Cause so innocent, so just, can look to escape Scot free ?"
20198,"But thus we see, ö Lord, and thou better seest, what truth these Canonists have in them, whose words pretend all right to the Subject, and whose deeds doe practise the bringing of all mens soules, bodies, and estates under the yoake of an universall Tyran∣ny."
20199,"For the third (the setting up of an independent coactive power  they say, this being meant of the State of Religion: if it be Papall, it is altogether unlawfull, as being Antichristian: but being according to thy word, every Christian State is bound to it up, and maintaine it, and no Christian King ought to hinder, or oppose it."
20200,"But as for all Pre∣, it is meerly Papall, and Anti∣christian; though not in the first degree, the Pope usurping an universall power over all the Churches in the world) yet in a second, Every Prelate in his Diocese exercising a Papall power, and so doth  and overthrew Gods Sacred Ordinance, who hath given a power and charge to Kings to suppresse all such Ecclesiasticall Tyranny over the soules of his people."
20201,"And whereas they say, the Royall Office, is the Sacred Ordinance of God: we all acknowledge it; and that this Ordinance of God comprehends in it not onely the institution of the Superiority of Kings over their people, but their Speciall office of Government, as it is limited and establishd upon those Laws and Covenants, and Conditions agreed upon between the Prince and People: These are a Speciall part of thy Divine Ordinance,☜ that Kings should governe by a Law (as Deut 17."
20202,"and that they should inviolably keep those Oathes and Covenants, that they have solemnly made with their people."
20203,"And therefore, they which perswade Kings, that they are no way boun, but have liberty to rule as they list, by an indepen∣dent Prerogative, these are they, that are traytors, both to God, and to the King, and to the Realme, and to the peace, and prospe∣rity thereof."
20204,"For the Fourth, For Subjects not to beare Armes against their King offensive, or defensive, upon any pretence whatsoever, as being a resiing of the Powers Ordained of God: First, we hold, that no private person ought to take up armes against his Prince: but Secondly, if a King maintaine a Faction about him, which goe about to oppresse s whole Kingdome,☞ and People in their Law and Libertis, and most of all in the true Religion, so as he will not rule them by the good Laws of the Kindome, but seeks to make all his Subjects Slavs; by bringing their soules, Bodies estates a miserable bondage: is it not now high time for the whole State either to labour to heale the breach, or if necessity (when there is no other remedy) to stand up is one man to de∣fend themselves and their Countrey, untill the Faction shalbe casheed, and so the King reforme himselfe, and renew Covenant and of the Kingdome to the good and just of the People."
20205,"And wheras i is point trench∣eth upon the Scots, at this time, what doe they stand upon, but in the first place, to free their Religion from Antichristan usurpa∣on, Psal."
20206,4. which otherwise by and Tyranny would be brought to .
20207,"And for the Fst and last,  Ought not Ministers to consider, that they are also members of the Com∣mon-wealth, and live under the Law thereof?"
20208,"And being Subjects, ought they not to teach the people, that they love and hnour the King, and chearefully pay all such taxes, as by Law are due unto him, forasmuch as we all live under a Law?"
20209,"And the other side, ought not all Court-preachers to tell the christian and Lawlesse Government."
20210,"And this, ô Lord, we con∣ceive of this first Constitution, so farre as we are able to appre∣hend: committing the whole judgement thereof to thy uner∣ing wisdome."
20211,"The Second is, For the better keeping holy the day of his Majesties most happy Inauguration."
20212,"Ah, Lord; can this be to the honour of our King, when the annuall memory of his Inauguration is saine to be forced?"
20213,"What Canon or Constitution is for the continuation of the joyfull memory of Queen Elizabeth of ever blessed memory, which yet to this day ceaseth not?"
20214,"But o that our King would consider that word of thine,1 Sam."
20215,30  and then they might have spared this Canon for the Kings day.
20216,"No, no if these things be not reformed, aIe 1."
20217,"2. blacke day is haste∣ning on a pace; as thou, ô Lord, hast threatned in thy word for such Sinnes."
20218,And with thee there is no respect of persons.
20219,"King Iehjachim lived without being desired, and had the of an Asse; and it was written upon him, write this man childlesse, A man that hll not presper in the Earth, nor should be lamented, being dead; nor should any of i Seed prosper after him."
20220,"O how terrible art thou, ô Lord, to proud and obstinate Sinners, when not Kings Crowns and Scepters can secure of defend them from thy just hand?"
20221,"And how fearefull a judgement is that, when thouIob."
20222,"21. powrest contempt upon Princes, and weakenes the power of the mighty?"
20223,The Third Canon is: For suppressing of the growth of Popery.
20224,"O Lord, dost thou not see in this whole long Canon the naked hypocrisie of this Synod, clothing it selfe with many same figleaves of pious pretences (forsooth) for the suppressing of Popery?"
20225,"Yea Lord, their ypocrisie is so palpble herein, that all the world sees that this Constitution was purposely made to blind the eyes of the simple in these stirring times, wherin they see their Popish practises to grow into such hatred and detestation with all the Kings good Subjects."
20226,"What other, but these practises, have been the coles that have kindled the fire in our neighbour to make the greater report (but without shot) in so hotly assault∣ing the Tower of Babel: because in so doing, it may make the world beleeve, that contrary to the Doctrine of Canterbury) there is no Salvtion for  and then let all Court Papists looke to it; and withall, the President must a great part of his Relation, which he hath written in favour of Papists, especially silly and ignorant, to whom he grants Salvation in their Rigion: he must also retract his Say∣ing,  he must also that, wherein he assemeth with his Iesuite,Relat."
20227,"375. that none ght to come to the English Church, then and there in that manner to worship God, that is resolved of the truth of the Roman Church; or to the like effect: and the Relator himself holds the truth of the Roman Church, for he affirmeth it to be a true Church."
20228,"With many o∣ther new leaves which he must turne over, upon this suddaine motion  which if cordiall, they should first have rid all Churches from Images, Crucifixes, Altars, and the like, least in bringing Papists to Church, they should but change their Latine Popery into English Popery."
20229,"And now, ô Lord, we beseech thee to judge of the hypocrisie of this selfe-styled Sacred Synod, which under a pretence of sup∣pressing the growth of Popery, doe indeed supplant the true Faith and Religion amongst us, that so instead thereof they may at length, as fast as they can, set Idolatry up in her throne, and full ."
20230,"For besides all this, that is said, have they not set out many notorious Popish Books, as that called the Femall Glory, which makes the blessed Virgin to be a Goddesse to be adored, and called upon, or prayed unto, the whole Booke being a very packe of Idolatry throughout, and set out in English, and allowed by one of the Prime Prelates Chapleins?"
20231,"So also a Booke of one Shelford Priest, whose 5 Treatises are notorious grosse popery; with many other of the same branne, or meale, which have been published by Authority, and never any of them yet called in."
20232,"And some that have been called in, as Cozens Orisons, and Salis his Devotions, and others, yet go currant up and down, and are in every Papists pocket."
20233,"Now if these holy men of this Sacred Synod had inten∣ded indeed to suppresse the growth of Popery, they should have caused heaps of bonefires to be made of the Bookes in Smithfield."
20234,"But in all things touching this point, how ridiculously and palpably they have discovered their hypocrisie, especially the President and Father of the Synod, doe thou, ô Lord, judge."
20235,"The Fourth Canon is, Against Socinianisme."
20236,"Behold here, Lord, another devise, to set simples a wonde∣ring, what this Monster, Sociisine should be, which most men in England never so much as once heard named before, and which England I hope is free enough from, unlesse a certaine neighbour to it, which they call rminianisne doe not hale it in, as it hath done many other Heresis."
20237,"For as for the Remon∣sirants; or Aminians, they professe society and communion with the Socimans rather then with the Orthodox Protestants, whom they call Cavinists."
20238,"Yea and in sundry of their Heresies they border neare upon them, as maintaining  So as doth not the Synod mi∣stake the name?"
20239,"Should they not have said, against Arminia∣nisme?"
20240,"Or perhaps they name the  both because they would make the people be∣leeve it is that, which hath so much been cryed downe by Preachers under the Name of Arminianisme, and yet they will save Arminianisme harmelesse, to which they have been so much beholden: and also because Arminianisme doth in many things Symbolize with Sccinianisme, under which it may the more easily lye hid."
20241,"But for Arminianisine sake, the President hath, in a Declaration in the Kings Name before the 39 Articles made the Articles touching Grace, Election, Predestination, &c. to speake aswell in favour of it, as of the truth it selfe."
20242,"Or would they prevent the contagion of Socinianisme, as also of Arminianisme?"
20243,"Call in those Orders, which restraine young students in the Vniversitie for reading our Protestant Authors."
20244,The Fifth Canon: Against Sectaries.
20245,"In this Canon they name Seperatists, whom especially they meane, as indeavouring (as they say)  on these they lay load in good earnest indeed, and on all those, that shall print or publish Bookes especially against the Discipline and  This is indeed their faire Goddesse Diana, of which these Craftsmen, who get their great Incomes by her, are so jealous, and doe so furiously thunder against the opposites."
20246,"And surely, ô Lord, if thou dost not at this time helpe, they poore people, who cannot with a good Conscience (if but rightly infor∣med) hold communion with these men in their Discipline and under their Government, must needs goe to wracke, and be ut∣terly spoyled they and theirs."
20247,The Sixt Canon: An Oath injoyn'd for the preventing of all Innovations in Doctrine and Government.
20248,"Ah Lord, here is the filling up of the measure of all iniquity, ol all cruelty and tyranny."
20249,"When they have brought their plots to passe, when established and setled their Innovations both in Doctrine and Government, then these hypocrites come with for the preventing of all Innovations in Doctrine and Government."
20250,This for the Title of the Canon.
20251,"And that they may exalt their hypocrisie to the height, that it may appeare to all men, they further say: This Present Synod being desirous to de∣clare their sincerity and Constanc in the profession of the Doctrine and in the Church of England, and to secure all then against any suspicion of volt to Popery, or any other Supersti∣tion.)"
20252,"Decres, &c. Now, Lord, can the hypocrisie of Rome it selfe in that Mystery of Iniquity, packed up in the Councel of Trent, surpasse this notorious hypocrisie of our English Prelates in this their Synod?"
20253,"The vaile of their soule hypocriste is the pretence of Sincerity, and Constancie in the profession of the Doctrine and Dis∣ine already established: they have now  and so they are desirous to declare their Sincerity and Constancie in the professi∣on of the same."
20254,"O holy Lord, who is able to deale with these impious hypocrites, but thy selfe alone?"
20255,"And now that they have tained their ends in a good measure (for they do not meane to stay here, till they have finished the Tower of Babel to its full height, by degrees, after a while) they doe this  For when the Revolt to Popery and the Superstitions thereof, is now in a good measure already made, then would they have all  But what need men to feare, when the danger is already past, and without re∣medie?"
20256,"They have set up their Altars; they gently intreat ado∣ration thereunto, and that by the same arguments that Papists use to colour over such Idolatry, till they have learne in fuller termes to expresse themselves with a We will and Command: they have set up their Images, and Crucifixes in Chappels and Ca∣thedralls, and that over the Altar; for all other Churches to con∣forme thereunto; they have published Bookes in English full of most grosse Romish Idolatry and Superstion; they have cryed down the due Sanctification of the Christian Sabbath-day, and have layd open the sdgtes to all proanesse to breake in, by publike spensation of profane Sports and Pastimes, that so they make the Lords day the day; and to make way for such profane Sports, they have universally forbid all preaching in the ernoones upon thy Holy Day; they have made thy holy Com∣mandment for the keeping and Sanctifying of thy Day of none effect, and that not onely by their profane practises, but profes∣sedly by their Book's published by Authority; they have by Edicts made the Articles of Rgion of the Church of England con∣cerning Grace to be of none authority: they have set forth Rlation of a Contnce, by Will of Canter∣burie."
20257,"Books, wherein they professe that the  and goe about to Father the Antichristian Iurisdictn and Government of Prelates, upon the Divin ution, and upon the practise of thy holy Apostles; and doe cry down the Authority of thy Sacred word, as an insufficient witnesse to prove it selfe the word of od, and as a dead and dumbe judge and insufficient to determine doubt and Controversies in points of Faith, and so doe set up Authority above the Scripture; they have cast out all, or most of those godly and painfull Mi∣noers of thy word, which were as so lights, and pillars in the house of our God, because they stood in the gappe, and in the way of these men, to hinder their wicked attempts in over∣throwing of all true Religoon; and if any good Ministers be yet left, that have escaped their fingers, here is a hellish plot will hurle them all out at a clappe: these with many other their Inn vations they having now brought to passe, now, now would they have all men to be secure against any revolt to Popery Now they declare their constancie and   This present Synod decrees, that all Archbishops, and Bi∣shops, and all other Priests and Deacons in places exempt or not exempt, shall take an against all Innvations of Doctrine or Discipline."
20258,"And the I, A. B. doe sweare, that I doe ap∣prove the Doctrine and Discipline, or Government established in the Church of England, as containing all things necessary to Salvation: And that I will not indeavour by my selfe, or any other, directly, or indirectly, to bring in m Popish Doctrine, contrary to that which is so established: Nor will I ever give my assent to alter the Govern∣ment of this Church, by Archbishops, Bishops, Deanes, and Arch∣deacons, &c. as it stands now established, and as by right it ought to stand, nor yet ever to Subject it to the usurpation, and Superstitions of the Sea of Rome, &c. And if any shall refuse to take this Oath, after the first moneth, he shalbe suspended from his Ministry: after the second moneth, from his Ministry and Benefice: and after the third moneth, deprived of all his Ecclesiasticall promotions whatsoever, and execution of his function which he holds in the Church of England."
20259,"And so this Oath extends to all Graduates in Divinity, Masters of Graduates, or licensed practitioners in Law and Physicke, all Registers, Actuaries, Proctors, Schoolmasters, all that enter into the Ministry, or into a Benefice, &c. Thus Lord, it is not suffi for these men to alter both the Doctrine, and Discipline of the Church of England (as aforesaid) and to make the  more An∣tichristian, then it was before, by adding a new claime of Di∣vine Authority to their Antichristian Iurisaction, blasphemoully fatherig it upon thee: but they must have all this Sealed with an Oath of all such Persons, as aforesaid, that so by so many condu pipes, the whole Land may be poysoned, and at once universally enthralled under a most miserable bondage."
20260,"And now subscription (which were too much, and against all Law and Conscience) is not sufficient."
20261,"For all Ministers, and others of any degree forementioned, must sweare to the ratifying of the of the Articles of Religion, as aforesaid: to the setting up and bowing to Altars, with all the other Ceremonies and Innovations about them: to the maintaining of an Anti chri∣stian Tyranny exercised by the Prelates, under the name of Christ and his Apostles: and so in Summe, they must become Sworne vassals to these Tyrants, and Sworne Enemies to thy Majesty and Kingly Soveraignty, to thy word and Scepter, to their owne Salvation, and the Salvation of thy people, and so proclaime themselves to all the world, the most base and vile Slaves, that ever the earth bred."
20262,"Yea the most of them (such especially as know anything; and this time of light admits of no plea for ignorance in any man) must of necessity (if at all they take this Oath) Sweare against their own Consciences, and so in no small degree sin against the Holy Ghost; whereby their Sin becomes unpardonable, when once their Conscience is eared to impe∣nitencie and their selfe-damnation sealed up to destruction."
20263,"Besides all this, if they looke upon temporall respects, are they sure the King of this Land will be alwayes of the mind, to maintain and continue such an Hierarchie?"
20264,"What, if God should be pleased in mercy to hi Church, to open the eyes of the King, to let him see now he and his State is abused by this Generation of Prelates, so as to ot them out?"
20265,"Againe, though the Office o Kings be mortall, yet their persons are not: another King may succeed that is of another md."
20266,"And above all this, we be∣leeve, ô Lord, that the intolerable outrages, and high flown presumptions of these Prelates against thee, and thy Church, and against the whole State of the Land, are most certaine, cleare, and immediate forerunners of their most fearefull ruine."
20267,"And therefore, let thy feare, ô Lord, be upon all thy Ministers and People of the Land at this time, and let thy grace be sufficient for them, to arme them with a holy courage, zeale, magnanimity, un∣daunted constant restion to stand out in a Christian defiance against this most damnable and desperate Oath, least the taking of it bring certaine wrath upon the takers, as the making and imposing of it shall certainly bring upon the makers and impo∣sers of it, to their utterdestruction."
20268,"ô Lord, have not these Prelates already made way for an unwerall admittance of this their Cursed Oath?"
20269,"For where is fearce one good Minister left, of a true bred masculine Spirit, whom these men have not rid out of the way?"
20270,"And those that be left, are they not for the most part such as either preferre the fleshpots of Aegypt before Canaan?"
20271,"Or such, as have already deled their Consciences with absing their Ministry to the publick obeying of wicked Com∣mands of these their great Masters?"
20272,"as in the publick reading the Booke of profane Sports on the Lords day: forbearing to preach in the Afternoones: admitting of Altars in their Churches: and perhaps bowing unto them: not to preach freely the Doctrines of Grace, to the strengthening of the faith of Gods people, and inflaming their love towards God as the 17th Article saith) and to the confounding of the enemies of Grace, and that cursed Faction, that now raign∣eth?"
20273,"So as Ministers, having universally defiled their Consciences, and abased their Ministry in these things (for such as refused, are already cast out) are already prepared and sitted to doe any other base service, that these their Masters shall command, their Conscience being by this time made wide enough to swallow downe this monstrous and damnable Oath, which could not possibly have been forged in any other Shop, but in hell it selfe, not by any other workmen, but by Devils themselves in the likenesse of men."
20274,"But, ô Lord, thou whoIud 24. onely art able to keep thine from saking, and to reserve them faultlesse before the presence of thy glory with joy; whoEsa."
20275,"3. wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose nd is stayd on thee; because he trusteth in thee: if thou hast a rem∣nant left, which have  but have kept their garments pure; or if any, who through feare or humane frailty have abased themselves in any of the things a∣foresaid: restore them by repentance, and establish them all by thy Grace, that they may so stand for thy Truth and their Salva∣tion here, as they may one day stand undaunted before the Son of Man at his appearing."
20276,"And further we note out of the words of the Oath, That they are to Sweare they doe approve the Doctrine and line established in the Church of England, as containing all things necessary to Salvati∣on."
20277,"Now will they say, that the Discipline, or  seeing herein they joyne it with Doctrine, as containing together all things necessary to Salvation?"
20278,"Nay, is not the Discipline and Go∣vernment, any enemy to Salvation, seeing it is altogether Anti∣christian, Tyrannicall, and a meere usurpation, and in the whole practise of it, and in all the Rites and Ceremonies, against the word of God, and against the Doctrine and Practise of the Apo∣stles, and a most notorious and pestilent persecuter of the true Saints and Servants of God, and a rooter out of all true Religion and godlinesse out of the Land."
20279,"Is it not Antichristian, and usurp∣ing Christs Throne and Soveraignty over the Consciences of his People, which is expresly and directly contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, so as the subjection thereunto is clearely proved by theCol."
20280,"8, &c▪ Apostle to be a denying of Christ, and so a loosing of Sal∣vation?"
20281,"And for the Doctrine of the Church of England, how can it be sayd  when the most principall Articles of Saving Grace are made of none effect, and are forbidden to be preached to the people?"
20282,"And suppose all the 39 Articles were intire, and not corrupted, but preserved in their true sense, agreeing with Scripture (asArticle of Consecration of Archbishops, &c. some of them are not) yet they cannot be sayd  For onely the holy Scripture, which is the onely  it being a cleare Commentary and exposition of it selfe, and a Rule whereby to try all humane writings of Divinity whatsoever."
20283,"Thus the matter of the Oath it selfe is most false, and blasphemous, which with all the rest we referre to thy judgement, ô Lord."
20284,"Againe, A man must sweare, not to bring in any Popish Doctrine, nrary to that which is so established."
20285,We conceive this to be no Church.
20286,"Secondly, for Bishops, we find the name indeed in ∣ture, but not a Diocesan Bishop, but such a one, as a particular Congregation, to feed the flocke of God, as thy teacheth."
20287,"And we find Deacons also, but no Archdeacons."
20288,"And to set Archdeacons over Presbyters, is not onely an incougity and disorder, and so not right, as it ought to be: but also a Antichristian guise and usurpation."
20289,"As for Deanes, they are of a later institution."
20290,"And as for Archbishops, they confesse, that the Apoes were all equall; how come they then to be superiour to other Diocesan Bishops, who claime to be the Apostles success By this reckoning, an Archbishop should have been superiour to the Apostls."
20291,"So as this Archiepiscopall Government, stands not rightly established, as being in a more Superlative degree Anti∣christian, then ordinary Bishops; nor can he with them shift or put off their Government to be Antichristian and Papall, the Me∣tropolitan of all England being that over England, which the Pope challengeth to be over the Church Catholicke."
20292,"And that the present Arch-Prelate carries himselfe as the Pope of England, whose Canon is a Law, let but this wicked Synod witnesse, whereof he is the Papall President, and this Papall Oath withall, which is drawn up and imposed on all Ministers, after the man∣ner of that Oath, which Paul the fourth added to his Councel rent, for all his Clergie to take, and so to Sweare to all the  Thus, ô Lord, we could not, but in this perplexed case open our minds, and (as the Prophet saith:Ier."
20293,1 open our Cause before thee.
20294,The Seaventh Canon: A Declaration concerning some Rites and Ceremonies.
20295,"This Canon is generally for an uniformity in will-worship throughout all England, and particularly in the introducing of Altars in every Church, with the Service about it."
20296,"The Canon for this, first pretends,  Now this outward worship is meerly of mans devising, a will-worship, and expresly forbidden and condemned by theCol."
20297,"Apostle, and therefore no Service of God: So as the uni∣formity herein overthroweth not onely the unity of Faith, but the faith it selfe, as Col."
20298,"And againe, such will-worship of mans invention, is a fruit of the pride and presumption of mans aine and gracelesse heart, and so cannot be truely called the Ser∣vice of God."
20299,"For our God hates all such service, as himselfe hath not commanded and prescribed in his word; according as thou ."
20300,"Againe, this Sd pretends for this their wished uniformity in worship two things: 1. the avoyding of suspicious feares of Innovation by the weake: 2. the hope of Papists, of Englands backes∣ding into Popish Superstition; and both, by reason of the Situation of the Communion Table, and the approaches thereunto."
20301,"And might not the Synod then with more ease, have removed quite away, both the feare of the one, and the hope of the other, in leting the Commu∣nion Tables stand, where they were wont to do?"
20302,"When a Stum∣bling blocke stands in a darke way, whether is it not better (for the preventing of stumbling) to remove the blocke, then to write upon it, Beware of this Stumbling blocke?"
20303,"Shall not every man that passeth that way, sooner break his Shinnes, or bones, then ake notice of the writing for prevention?"
20304,"And can every one take warning by the Canon to avoyd the offence, so well, as if the Scandall were quite taken away?"
20305,"When in Ezek his time the people began to worship that monument of the brazen Serpent, the good King brake it to pieces."
20306,And is it not better e now Altars to be set up in all Ces throughout England hereupon the Synod tells us (for it is conscious enough of it) Papists slatter themselves with a hope of our backeding into their Popish Superstition.
20307,How come they thus to hope?
20308,"From the seting up of your Alts, you will say."
20309,"And to what purpose then is your former  when this Canon will make them grow faster, out of a hope of Englands backesding to them, then the former will Suppresse their growth, for feare of all the emptie charge thereof, or for any counterfeit shows these men can make of winning them to our Church?"
20310,"unlesse the Altars be of more force to doe it, when they see especially those Superstitions, or rather Idolatrous approaches thereunto."
20311,"But the Synod calls their hope, a vaine hope."
20312,"That's the Synod vain hope, or rather hypo∣criticall dissimulation: For they know it to be most true, and the Papists have reason so to hope, as some of their own Authors in their late English pamphlets have jeangly writ of Englands backtiding to Popery, as of a thing, whereof  And for the feare and jealousie, which they say the weake have hereof: have not the wisest men in the King∣e the like feare and jealousie, and that upon just causes and grounds?"
20313,"And suppose the weake onely were offended with such things: why did not the wise, and Sacred rather remove the Scandall, then slappe them in the mouth with the Fox tayle of Canon, or smoke out their cryes with the charge The strong (as saith the Apostle) ought to beare with the of the weake, and not to please themselves."
20314,"But the Synod tells us, That the standing of the Communion-Table way under the East window of every Chancel or Chappell, i its nature indifferent, neither commanded, nor condemned by the word of God, either expresly, or by immediate deduction, and ther∣fore that no Religion is to be placed therein, or sruple to be made thereon."
20315,"First, if it be a thing indifferent, why doe they trouble me Consciences of their weak brethren with it, who hold it to be a thing Scandalous?"
20316,"This is against the Apostles Rule, even the rule of Charity, tending to the destruction of mens soules."
20317,"Se∣condly, if a thing indifferent, why are they so eagre for it, when it may as well be forborne, and especially at this time, when both the Kingdomes, and the wisest men therein, are so troub∣led with it, the eace disturbed, the State distracted, and the Kingdomes hazarded?"
20318,"Thirdly, if it be indifferent, why doe they not so leave it?"
20319,"Why doe they alter the nature of it, turn∣ing the indifferencie into a necessity, as they doe with all their other Ceremonies, which they professe to be in their own nature indifferent, yet turne them out of their nature, and make them necessary, and so intolerable burthens to mens Consciences?"
20320,"Yea why doe they force all Ministers to take a Solemne Oath, that they approve these things, as necessary to be observed?"
20321,"But neither is this they so urge, a thing in its own nature indifferent, namely, whether the  For, first, it is a Commu∣nion Table, and therefore to stand in the midst, where all may sit about it, as about a Table, and thus it is rightly and properly a Communion-Table: it is not a Communion-Cubbord, or a Com∣munion dresser, to stand Side-way to the wall."
20322,That's no Commu∣nion Table.
20323,"And consequently such a standing Sideway to the wall of every Chancel is by  For the word of God calls and commends, and com∣mands this by the name of the Lords Table, and so it commands withall the proper use of it, as of the Table of the Lord: but the standing of this Table Sideway to the wall, takes away not onely the nature, and indeed the name of a Table, but also the proper use of the Lords Table, where every one of his family is to sit about it."
20324,As David saith; 28.
20325,Thy Children like olive plants round about thy table.
20326,For such is the right and proper use of a Table.
20327,"And therefore, as the Scripture commands and commends unto us the Lords Table, with the right use thereof, as is sutable to the nature of it: So by necessary consequence, and immediate de∣duction, the Scripture condemnes any such posture or placing ther∣of, as altee both the nature and use of the Lords Table."
20328,"So as it is not a thig indifferent, whether the Table stand sideway to the wall: for it ought not so to stand, seeing it is a perverting of the nature and use of the Table of the Lord, and so a perverting of the Lords Ordinance."
20329,"Againe, not indifferent for all Chancels alike: for in many vast Churches the People cannot heare, when their Priest sayes or sings his Second Service at his new Altar, as he is injoyned: unlesse the Ordinary be more mercifull to the Congregation, were it a mercy to communicate with Superstitious worship and Service."
20330,"Againe, the word of GodEze."
20331,"12, expresly condemnes in his people the mitation of the heathen in their Idolatry, or Superstition, or to doe after their manner."
20332,So as such guises are not things indiffe∣rent.
20333,"Now for the standing of the  is to place it like to Popish Altars, which are Altars of Idolatry, like to those of the heathen; and so is a faire induce∣ment by degrees of their Idolatrous Sacrifice too, for all the faire pretences the Synod makes to the contrary."
20334,"And doth not the Synod confesse, that  Then we aske thy Synod, why they are here so zealous in seting up the  Seeing before they pretend such care and zeale  and for the bringing of Papists to the English Church?"
20335,"Where, when they come, and presently see a thing  just like their high-Altar, and seeing withall the people, or Priest lowly lowting unto it, or devoutly bowing before it, or toward it: are they not hereby straight put in mind of their old Romish Idolatry, enough to make them presently to turne Papists againe?"
20336,"Where is then the carefull provision of this Synod, that all meanes be used to root out of the minds of such both the inclination and memory of the Idolatry of the Masse, for which cause our ancient Reformers caused all Romish Altars to be demoli∣shed?"
20337,"times in the place, where the Altars formerly stood, but in time of of; in the midst of the Church or Chancel."
20338,"And yet the uction did not necessarily tye the Table to stand at all other times, saving at the  but for most conveniencie, according to the discretion of the Minister and Gardians."
20339,"And certainly the good Queens intent never was, are could be, that that standing so at other times, should be a precedent for aftertimes, to introduce Altars againe, there to have a fixed station, and so to become a stumbling blocke to Protestants, and a laughing stock to Papists, causing the one to feare Innovations, and the other to  And that the Table hath  there is not the same reason of a Chappel, and of a Church; a Chappel wanting converent roome to place the Table in the midst."
20340,"Although this was to be imputed ra∣ther to want of Care in the Deane of the Chappel, then want of roome in the Chappel, as in many other things besides."
20341,"And as for Cathedra Churches, most of them had the Tables standing in the midst of the Chancel, untill of very late dayes, and under this Kings Rugne, wherein our Prelates have been more stick∣ing then ordinary to erect not only Altars, but Crucifixes, and Images in all Cathedralls."
20342,"And now their project plainly appeares to be this, that by these Mother Churches as they call them, they might introduce Altars into all other Churches, to verifie the Proverbe, Like Mother, like Daughter."
20343,"And whereas they name ome Parochiall Churches to have had Altars, this hath been but of late dayes too, since this fashion began to be renewed."
20344,"But when they have Summ'd up all together, it will not a∣mount to the acquitting this Generation from illegality, or from more then suspicion, and that ust, both of Romish Superstition, and dolatry to boo, as also of a great Innovation of the State of the Church both in Doctrine and Discipline."
20345,"For first, for the Royall Chappel what are they to an universality?"
20346,"If the King should have Misse in his Chappell, must therefore every Church in the Land have so too?"
20347,"And so for Cathedralls, what are they, bu as i were the Chappels, or Chancels of the Bishop, Dane and Chapter?"
20348,"Parish-Churches they are no; no nor yet Mother-Churches, as whereof other Churches are begotten, but are the very dennes of the Dragon, and the Styes, to fa be for the slaughter."
20349,"And because some Parhia Churche by some Ministers of the Bishops Faction have lately Altars: is this sufficient to acquit them of egalify of of Rmish Superstition and Idolatry, in making hereupon, a Canon for the  Dare these bring this their mettall to be tryed in a Parliament-Tes, where they should find Refiners of suffi judgement to sever the silver, (if there were any) from the drsse?"
20350,But when they have se up their Tables Sidewayes to the Eastill: shall they stand there fixed?
20351,"Shall they not be move∣ables still, as in Queen Elizabeths time, and according to her In∣junction at least be t in the midst of the Church or Chancel, a the Comm?"
20352,"For this, they tell us, We judge it fit, and conve∣nient, that all Churches and Chappels do conforme themselves in th particular, to the example of the Cathdrall, or Mother Churches, saving alwayes the generall liberty lest the Bishop by Law, during the time of the Administration of the holy Communion."
20353,A plausible Perswasion of these Hypes.
20354,They thinke it fit: therefore who will not thinke it so?
20355,They heartily commend it: and what is this but a Command?Peanagke Es.

20359,For what be these Rites and Ceremo∣nies?
20360,"namely, as the seting up of a high Altar, so adoration thereunto."
20361,"This is that which these Hypocrites thinke and com∣mend for very fit and behoofull pretending therein Service done to thy Majestie, when it is indeed a Service that pleases them, and which to thy dishonour, and against thy will and word, they will force upon thee."

20365,"Even as the false Oracles of old, Cap."
20366,"(Ten apsukon hulen ebem prosetation) commanded men to worship a piece of wood, or such like matter, wherein was no life."
20367,"But these lying Oracles, these Hypocrites pretend such worship is to honour thee withall."
20368,"O notorious hypocrisie▪ These are the Men, that trample thy word under their feet, that cast it out of the Church, that stoppe thy Ministers mouthes, and consequently thy peoples Eares that they cannot heare thy lively voyce speaking unto them to the Saving of their poore soules: and instead hereof they give unto them a flappe with a Fox-tayle: for instead of honouring thee in thine own Sacred and Saving Ordinance, they commend to thy People these Superstitious and Idolatrous Services, as the fruits of their prod and profane Popish hearts, which they commend as most fit and behofull."
20369,4.  and give them the reward of selfe-pleasure.
20370,"Now we know, that all Cathedrall or those Mother Churches, have their Altars fixed, and never removed, no not in time of Communion: by this Law of Conformity therefore, all Parechiall Churches must have their Tables fixed, and never to be removed, no not at the Communion."
20371,"And so being fixed, they cease now to be any longer Tables, but put on the nature of Altars, which stand perpetually fixd."
20372,"Onely here is one helpe peradventure for it, if the Bishop be pleased to give liberty to Parishes to remove the Table into the midst r the Communion; this liberty alwayes Saved."
20373,So as here is all the hope of Parishes in this matter.
20374,"Yet what hope, when the Bi∣shop shall answere such Suiters, Ye are a sort of Puritans; will you be wiser then your Mother-Church, or wiser then the Sacred and holy Synod, who judged it fit and convenient, that all Churches and Chap∣pels doe conforme themselves in this particular to the example of th Cathedrall, or Mother Churches?"
20375,"And though the Law give him a generall Liberty in this to grant it, or no: yet he holds him∣selfe rather bound by the Canon in this case, not to give liberty, then dispensed to take and use liberty by the Law."
20376,"But yet for all this the Synod gives one remedy, as to thinke never a whit the worse of the Table, or to be out of conceit with it, because being thus fixed, it seems to be quite turned from a Table into an Altar: for it addeth:  doe these holy men call it: but shall we thinke it ever a whit the holyer, that it stands now fixed sideway to the wall?"
20377,"Yes: for it is now an Altar: yet not a true and proper Altar, as  no, so the Papists in some sense will say for their Altars."
20378,"But what say they to this: doe they not meane it is such an Altar, as without which the Sacrifice, or offering upon it it is not sanctified Or is it not that Altar, wher∣of the Apostle speaks,lib."
20379,"We have an Altar, &c?"
20380,"If it be not that Altar, why doe they suffer Dr."
20381,"Pecklingtons Christian Altar, so to passe under their Authority, which saith,  And why doe they suffer other Bookes, that say, The Apostle meant this Altar, when he said, We have an Altar?"
20382,"When therfore this Synod calls in, and damnes these Bookes which by maintaining these Al∣tars of wood and stone, doe overthrow and deny the onely Al∣tar Iesus Christ: we may think, that these men have some good meaning, when they say,  Now who knows how farre these men extend the Pri∣mitive Church?"
20383,"Perhaps down to Innocent 3, who first establi∣shed Transubstantiation, now above foure hundred yeares agoe, For as for the purest estate of the Primitive Church, as in the Apostles times, the Table of the Lord; was never called an Altar at all, properly or improperly."
20384,The Scripture calls it only the Table of the Lord.
20385,"And some hundred yeares after the Apostles, Cstans had no Altars at all, no not in name, which the Hea∣then did obiect unto them."
20386,So as the Primitive Church in the purest time of it had not so much as the name of Altars.
20387,And our Communion Booke doth not once name it an Altar.
20388,"How comes then this Synod to be so bold, as to call the Table an Al∣tar, and teach, that it is, and may be so called▪ And what if some Fathers called it so▪ As they were a little too free (though meaning no harme) in their allegorising, which the Romanists have made advantage of, to advance their Idolatry."
20389,"And Lord, thou shalt try the spirit of these men, whether for the love they beare to Rome, and to bring England to a perfect Recon∣ciliation with her, they affect to call it an Altar, rather then a Table; though the time is not yet ripe for them, fully to mani∣fest themselves, and to display their Roman Colours in open fields."
20390,"But for us, we ought not in any sense to call the Lords Table an Altar, seeing the Scripture calls it onely a Table, and never, an Altar: and seeing also it is an easie inducement to Popish Idolatry and Superstition, to which use all Papists use it, and which use this Synod, by all signes shows it selfe easie to be intreated to bring up againe in the Church of England."
20391,"For in the next place, they make an Order for rayling in this Altar, to seperate it from the rest of the Church, that none doe touch it, as if it were more holy, and the matter thereof more precious, then any other part of the Church."
20392,"And by this meanes, though they pretend the prevention of profanation, yet they labour to beget in the Peoples minds some high and re∣verend opinion of this their Altar, as of some extraordinary holy creature, or rather divine thing, that so they may with the more facility, and lesse seupe be brought to yeeld adoration ther∣unto, when ever they but look upon it, or approach it, or passe by it; of which they tell us more anon."
20393,"And the next thing is,  condemning the usuall manner of the Ministers carrying the bread and wine about the Church."
20394,"But they called this Altar a Ta∣ble, but even now: and is it so suddainly swallowed up in an Altar, as in stead of sitting about the Table (which is Christs own ordinance, and the proper use and posture of guests about a Table) now men must kneele before the Altar, as before some new God-Allmighty?"
20395,"So as thine ordinance, ô Lord, is here quite per∣verted, and from a Table-Communion turned into a Superstitious Altar-Service."
20396,"Whereas if the Table were set in the midst, and the Communicants did come and sit round about it, as many as could at a time, and so did eat and drinke the Lords Supper, this is Christs own ordinance: but to come and kneele before an Al∣tar, this is not according to Christs ordinance, nor is it  The last tging is, after many faire pretences and preambles (as of the  and the like) the  And the motives which the Synod useth to perswade all People hereunto, are sundry."
20397,"(as they call it) rather the  &c. Now from these words (though the Synod doe not expressely and directly Order, that men in doing such reverence and obeysance, do  where it standeth) yet we learne plainly their meaning to be so, in that they say, not with any in∣tention to exhibit any religious worship to the Communion Table, or East: Ergo towards the Table, or East, men must doe reverence, s it be not with intention of Religious worship."
20398,"But by their leaves, Intention, or not intention, so to bow, so to doe reverence to, or to∣wards this, or that place, is no lesse, then flat Idolatry, whether it be done to the place it selfe, or thereby to God."
20399,"For God will not be worshiped in or by either an Image, or any representation of his Majesty or Divine presence; as if God were fixed to this or that place, all which is forbidden in the Second Commande∣ment."
20400,"And being done to the creature, as to the Table, or Altar, or towards the East, being done in the Church, which they say is the place of Gods worship, must not all such externall worship there exhibited, be a religious worship▪ So as whether People intend any such thing, or no, as by doing obersance to the Table, to exhibit religious worship, yet the worship it selfe so exhibited in the place of Gods worship, is, must needs be a religious, yea and divine wor∣ship."
20401,So as here is flat Idolatry committed by authority of this holy Synod.
20402,"Or will they call this adoration (for adoration it is) a civil worship▪ This is no lesse an absurdity, and grosse profanation of things Sacred, to give them a Civil worship."
20403,"Therfore seeing the Synod will needs have a worship so exhibited, and this is not (say they)  let them tell us what kind of worship they meane."
20404,"Unlesse their meaning be this, that it may passe for a religious worship, as of the body, so the intention of the mind be wanting; that so a man may commit Idolatry not yeelding a religious worship to the creature outwardly with his body, so as his mind be free from intention, that he meant no harme by it."
20405,"And the like reason there is for bow∣ing, or kneeling at the Communion: this is a religious worship, or adoration: and it is done, as to some imaginary corporall presence of Christ on the Table, or to the Elements themselves, or to the Table."
20406,"But to be done as to Christs corporall presence, the Syd would have that opinion forborne."
20407,"It remaines then, that the adoration, or religious worship to be done, though not intended, either to the Elements, or to the Table, or to the Altar, or to the East; for now all the Communicants are upon their knees all looking that way."
20408,"But say they, secondly, this worship is for the  Is it so?"
20409,"And is it not then a Religious worship, that is so exhibited, that is  Cer∣tainly this must needs be a Religious and Divine worship, and that in a high degree."
20410,"And being so, shall the Synod be ashamed, or affraid to allow men an Intention of performing this Religious worship, when it is for the avancement of Gods Majesty?"
20411,"Will God accept of a Sacrifice, that wants a heart?"
20412,"Or how is God honoured by our Service, when it is done without an Intention?"
20413,"But here is yet a worse matter in it, that marres the Synods in∣tention for the advancement of Gods Majesty."
20414,"And that is, All this worship (call it what they will) is a meere will-worship (of which before) and so of which God saith,Math."
20415,"And the Synop cannot but confesse, that all this Court-Ceremony is the upshot of this their Canon and Constitution: a Commandement of men therefore: and so abominable in Gods worship and Service."
20416,"But thirdly, This say they (to wit, this  Upon what necessity?"
20417,"For first, can that be pious in it selfe, which God hath absolutely for∣bidden and condemned, as abominable to be used in his Ser∣vice?"
20418,And such is all invention of man in Gods worship; as be∣fore.
20419,"Secondly, Profitable to us, say they."
20420,"Wherein profitable to us, to disobey and dishonour God in our fancifull devises?"
20421,"Or pro∣fitable, in that sense, wherein the Math."
20422,"It is a gift, by what∣sover thou mightest be profited by me: and honour not his Father or his Mother."
20423,"So, how can that beNilutile, quod non hone∣stum est."
20424,"profitable to us, which is disho∣nourable to our heavenly Father?"
20425,"And thirdly, for Edifying unto others: how Edifying?"
20426,"Surely no other way, but as the Apo∣stle saith,1 Cor."
20427,"(dikodo∣methéseta) be edified (as the word properly signifieth) that is,  And just such Edifying unto others, is this will-worship of the Synod, whereby they being men of knowledge and learning, doe edify or imbolden simple peo∣ple to follow their practise, and obey their Precept, in giving reverence and obeysance in the Church, that is, religious worship to a stone Altar, or wodden Table, which is Idolatry, though coloured over with never so specious and faire pretences, as  which is the ordinary apron of igleaves, wherewith the woman of Rome would cover the na∣kednesse of such herR."
20428,"Spirituall fornications, and filthinesse of her bominations."
20429,"But Fourthly, This (say they) hath been the most ancient custome of the Primitive Church in the purest times, and of this Church also for many yeares of the Raigne of Queen Elizabeth."
20430,"The reviving ther∣fore of this ancient and laudable Custome, we heartily commend to the serious Consideration of all good people."
20431,to common Idolatry with Stocks and Stones?
20432,For what were  Were they not the Apostles owne times?
20433,Were not thse the purest times of the Primitive Church?
20434,"And will they, dare they say, or much lesse, can they prove, that the Apostles, or the Church in their time used any such custome?"
20435,"Fy for shame, that a Synod should dare, without blush∣ing, to vent such abominable lyes."
20436,"For if they meane it of the times of the Church after the Apostles, those certainly were not the purest times, as wherein many Supersitions began quickly to grow up, to strow the way for the coming of Antichrist, the Mystery of Iniquity beginning to worke even in the Apostles dayes."
20437,"But this  That's true indeed; I my selfe, when I was a ad, have seen old women very ob∣servant in such obesances towards the Est, both coming in, and going out of the Church."
20438,They would not misse it.
20439,"But ye must undestand this was a place, where they had not Scarce one Sermon in Seaven yeares: So as, it was no marvaile if still they walked in darknesse, when they wanted the light to shine forth unto them in the preaching of the Gospel, which where it comes in the vigour of it, drives away all darknesse of errour, and spirituall blindnesse, as thePsal."
20440,22  as David saith.
20441,"Insomuch, as we have seen and known by abundant experience (blessed be our God) that in all places of the Kingdome, where sound preaching hath been, all such Superstition hath been packed out of the Church."
20442,"But this riddance could not be expected for some of the first yeares of Queen Elizabeth, when the Land was but newly crope out of Popery, and Preachers were but Scarce, and the old race had not, could not put away the old leaven, or cast off the Slough of Popish Superstition."
20443,"And therefore the Synod saith truth in this, that for some yeares, yea in some places, many of the Raigne of Queen Elizabeth (which was towards the beginning of her Raigne) these Superstitious customes were in use."
20444,"And had the Royall Chappels, and Cathedralls had as sound preachers in them usually: as other Parochiall Churches in the Kingdome, that would have ript up the  so fairely painted over in goodly Images, Crucifixes, and the like unre∣moved in those places: there had not by this time remained one Romish ragge, whereof this Synod might make a coat for the Church of England now to be fashioned by."
20445,"But now the Coat is made up, all the Skill will be how to perswade this whole Church to put it on."
20446,"Yea it is so little and strait, as being measured and patternd by two or three Chappels, and a few Cathedralls, it wilbe very hard to force it upon Eng∣lands broad backe, without extreme pinching of it, or tearing the Coat."
20447,"Now for this, in the last place, this Courteous and kind Sy∣nod, wheras it might command, is pleased to stoop so low, as to intreat, yea heartily to intreat, againe and againe: We (say they)  &c. And a little lower againe: The reviving of this ancient and Laudable Custome, we heartily commend to the serious cnsideration of all good people."
20448,"And for this, reason perswades us to beleeve, that the Synod is cordiall in redubbling such hearty Commendations of such Romish reliques and so Laudable Customes, to all good people."
20449,"First, because good people will not easily be drawn to such things, without some strong motive, nor with that, neither."
20450,"And secondly, could their hearty Commendations prevaile in this, it would greatly conduce to a speedy making up of that Reconciliation between the Church of England, and of Rome, so greatly desired and laboured in the Primates Late Re∣lation, the President of this Synod."
20451,"Who tells us there more plain∣ly what we may understand here by Commending; for (saith he, pag."
20452,"there is a Laudendo praecipere, by Lauding or Commending Command."
20453,And therefore they stick not to be so Liberall in their hearty Commendations of this brave piece of Service.
20454,"But why should now this Spirit be conjured up againe, or this dead Coale of Romish zeale revived, having for so long a time lyen consopited, yea dead under a heap of ashes, never to have kind∣led flames, or troubled the world againe."
20455,"Why should this Sa∣tan of our peace, which had been so long bound, now be let loose againe, to set Kingdomes in a combustion Surely they told us before, uniformty is to be desired."
20456,"How In a  But were it not every way better, that those few should give place, and rather conforme to the Generality of all the Churches in England, where these Supersti∣tions had been cast out, and all quiet: then that the Generality should conform to a few, to indanger the whole State, and haz∣zard the losse of all But in the last place, they come with a pretty handsome Close, saying,  O Lord God, Psl."
20457,"Can they not be content to abuse thy People, in leading and draw∣ing them into all manner of Superstition, but they must usurpe the Apostles rule, and pervert it to the maintenance of such blind and damned Rites?"
20458,"The Rule of the Apostle is for the use of things in their own nature indifferent, as eating, or not eating, wherein Charity is to preserve peace: but it gives no countenance at all to things altogether unlawfull in themselves, and no way indifferent; as before."
20459,"And had these men true Charity, they would be so farre from pressing these things to a generall use, as they would rather altogether suppresse them where they are used, as being a Stumbling blocke to the whole Land, upon the which, if not removed, the whole Land must stumble and fall."
20460,"And therefore had this Synod had any one sparke of an Apostoli∣call Spirit in it (as they show it to be altogether Apostaticall) it would in the first place have rather observed the Apostles Rule,  then breaking this Rule of Charity, have abused the Apostles words, to prescribe to a whole Land a Rule of false Charity."
20461,"But to thee, O Lord, doe we commit the judgement of this whole Cause, which we can doe no more, nor lesse but complain of to thy  Canon 8."
20462,Of Preaching for Conformity.
20463,"This Synod here, for the more strenthening of their Canons, and the more facilitating of the way to Conformity thereunto, must injone their Priests (whom they have in their chaine fast bound by Subscription, by Oath of Canonicall obedience, and by Oath of this Synod, to the observation of the Decrees thereof, and other their Lordships commands) to preach for Conformity, and inspeciall, for  which this Canon immediately succeeds, as pointing them to that be∣fore: as followeth in the Canon: the tenour whereof is: Whereas the Preaching of Order and Decencie, according to S. Pauls rule, doth conduce to Edification: it is required, that all Preachers (as well beneficed men, as others) shall positively and plainly preach and instruct the people in their publicke Sermons twice in the yeare at Soules from the yoake of such vile Slavery, unlesse you have so much courage in you as to deny to doe these base dudgerres for these your Tkemasters, though you be Suspen∣ded for it, and loose all you have Strengthen, Lord all the, to stand fast in thy truth, and not to betray it with them their People, and the whole State of the Land."
20464,"Now passing by the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th Canons, as of moment, in the 13th."
20465,Of Excommunication and Absolution not to be pronounced but by a Priest.
20466,Herein first we may observe what kind of Excommunications and Absolutions have been usuall in our Prelates extreme abusie and prefanation of Christs Ordinance of his Church.
20467,"Which Ordinance, as it doth belong to the Prelate (whose whole Order eere usurpation) so it is most basely abused, and their Officers."
20468,"So as here is a Reformat: at the best is stark nought, as being an usurpation."
20469,"For in this Canon they take away all power from every of his Congregation, to whom with others appointed by the Parish, according to Gods word, belongs the power of Ecclesia∣scall Censures."
20470,"And in this Canon also, he that is absolved, must become more bound, then ever he was before, because first he must take an Oath, de parendo Juri, & stando Mandatis be∣clesiae:  So as his Absolution becomes his bondage: when now in stead of Gods Commandements, he must be subject to the  which is an Anti∣christian Tyranny: and more now then ever before, for this Synod sake."
20471,"Againe, omitting the 14th and 15th Canon, the 16th is con∣cerning Licenses to Marry."
20472,"So as this Canon is to maintaine a Doctrine of Devils, mentioned by the Apostle, as namely forbidding to Marry (be it either to some sort of men, as Romish Priests, or to  as at such times (which altogether containe almost halfe of the yeare) without the Bishops Speciall Licence, no Man or Wo∣man may Marry."
20473,"Thus it is cleare, that herein these Hyporites the Sell Gods free Ordinance for money, and so maintaine a Doctrine of Devils."
20474,And thus farre of the Canons of this Synod.
20475,"The Conclusion of all which is, the Kings avowing, ap∣proving, confirming, and injoyning these Canons to be observed of all respectively, according to the tenure thereof in all and every part."
20476,"Hereof we will say no more, then we have sayd in the begin∣ing of our Complaint, committing all Judgement unto thee righ Iudge of all, and beseeching thee withall, that wilt judge the Cause of thy People, when now thou seest their strength is gone, and to take them and their and thy Cause into thy holy Protection, to vindicate both them, and it, thy own glorious Name from the cruelty and reproch o Men."
20477,"Here now follow some Predictions of, and some Contradi∣dictions unto this late Synod, observed and collected out of the Relation of a Conference by William of Canterbury."
20478,"F in his Epi Dedicatory to the King, he saith: The King and the Priest, more then any other, are bound to look to the Inte∣grity of the Church in Doctrine and Manners, and that in the first place."
20479,For that's by farre the best Hone.
20480,"that Priest, and what that Integity of the Church in Doctrine and Manners, con∣cluded in this late synod; but whether as in a Hive of Bees, or in a or Hornets nest, as wherewith whole Kingdomes the world judge."
20481,"And againe, ibid."
20482,"To deale clearely with your Majesty, these thoughts (of the externall worship of God) are they; and no other, which make me labour so much, as I have done, for Dceny, and an of the externall worship of God in the Church."
20483,"Primates  settle the Doctrine and Discipline, and external worship in the Church,  Synod."
20484,"So as it appeares, both this Synod, and the things concluded therein have been a good wile a hammering is Forge."
20485,"And in the Relation it selfe, pag 155."
20486,"To the (to wit, the Prince, and the Clergie) principally the power and direction for Refor∣mation belongs."
20487,"Princes have their parts by their Calling together of the Bishops, and others of the Clergie to consider of that, which might seem worthy Reformation: And the Clergie did their part in the Na∣tionall Synod, of 62."
20488,"And the Articles there agreed on, were afterwards firmed by Acts of State, and the Royall Assent."
20489,"Nationall Synod:  Nationall Synod, namely the confirmation by the Act of State, to wit, the Act of Parliament;  Contradiction, overthrowing this Nationall Synod; consisting of the two Provinciall, Canterbury and Yorke."
20490,"Both together want the Act of Parliament to confirme it a Nationall Synod, to bind the whole Nation, which the Synod presumes to doe, both in Ministers and People."
20491,"Emperours and Kings are Custodes utriusque Ta∣balae: they to whom the and preservation of both Tables of the Law for worship to God, and duty to man are committed."
20492,"A Booke of the Law was by Gods owne command in Moses his time was to be given to the King, Deut."
20493,"The Kings under the Law, but still according to it, did proceed to necessary Reformations in Church Businesses, and theirin commanded the very Priests themselves, &c. This being so, that the Kings under the Law had the care of the preservation of Gods Law and Religion committed unto them,  corruption had crept in, to reform Religion, but still according to Gods Law,  Synod of Priests (being assembled by Royall authority, and commanded by a King under the Gospel to treat and agree upon some Canons necessary for the advancement of Gods Glory, the edifying of his holy Church, and the due reverence of his blessed Mysteries and Sacraments) to be so bold, as to agree and conclude and enact such Canons and Constitutions, as are directly against the Law and word of God, to the great dishonour of God, the ruinating of his holy Church, and the great abuse and profanation of his blessed Mysteries and Sacraments?"
20494,"Lord Iesus Christ to be Judge, whether this Synod hath dealt faithfully, or no with the King, or between him and his people, and that also in these perillous times."
20495,"The Lord open the Kings eyes, to see how both himselfe, and his people,  Prelates and Priests, That Synods may erre and foulely too, this of 1640. proves with a ."
20496,"If any Canons of it be sound, the Sixth hath poyson enough to infect them all."
20497,"It's such a Cockatrice egge as was ne layd in England before, that eateth of a dyeth."
20498,"I will here a little bowell this Oath, and shew you the mischief in it."
20499,"THis Oath  An injoynd for the preventing of all Innovations in Doctrine and Government, being a grand Innovation,  et era, an expression yet unknown to the Christian Pagan world: Archbishop Arundell,  , & sub obtestatione divini judij inhibemus spcial , Cuuscunque gradus status aut condition, existat usiones aut proposi de ide Catholica, aut bens sonantes praeter necessarium Doctrina facultatis suae, in Scholis extra, disputando aut communicando, protestate perss permissa, asperat quodam verborum, vel er∣rum teste B.

20500,there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the Children of Israel came up out the Land of Aegypt unto this day;  Oath.
20501,spirituall Aegypt.
20502,"It's against the King and his Prerogative Royall, who by the Statutes and Customes of this Kingdome hath power to ap∣point any of his naturall Subjects to exercise all manner of Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction under him, as appeareth by Stat."
20503,cap 1. and Stat.
20504,"17. but this Oath spoyles his Majesty of all such power, investing onely Arch-bishops, Bishops, Deanes, &c. with Ecclesiasticall power, and so takes from his Majesty what his Predecessor Henry the had, who gave a Commission to Lord Crod to cise under him all Jurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, as you may in Mr."
20505,Fox his Martyrologie Volume 2. pa.
20506,"It's against the Oath of Supremacy, in taking of which we ac∣knowledge the Kings Majesty to be Supreme Governour of the Church, in all Causes, and over all persons Ecclesiasticall, as well as Civil; and the King by Law having power to alter Church Government, and to delegate whom he pleaseth of his Subjects to exercise Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction, as appeares by what is foresaid, and still is in practise in the High Comis∣sion, in which are alwayes the Lords of his Majesties Privy If the Oath be once lawfully taken, what new power can dis∣charge it?"
20507,in such a case they may aswell Unchristian me as unsweare me.
20508,"How can any honest sworne Subject take this New Oath without manifest danger and great suspition of per∣ary; for having sworne before for the King, in case he alter the Government, by vertue of this Oath I have sworne against the King, set up Oath against Oath, myselfe against my Sove∣raigne; and that which is yet worse, must not repent of it: For I am sworne from ever  And is that all?"
20509,"No, I must dissent and become a Schismatick, and Seperatist for ever: Neither is that all, but I must take up Armes twice a year at least, and Preach for the Hierarchie, and their present Government, against my Soveraigne, and that he hath charged."
20510,"This I am bound to by vertue of the Canon, and if not, by the Oath of Canonicall obedience."
20511,"And in case a Minister refuse or neglect this, it's Suspension by his , and if it be done, who knows but it may cst Hang∣ tuum, for resisting Supreme Authority."
20512,"Againe, this Oath is a plot to sweare in the conceit of Epis∣pacie to be jure divino: of late they have step'd off from their ancient foundation, thinking to weaknesse, either to depend vpon humane Laws, or Princes favours: and have published to the whole world, that their standing is by divine right: and ther∣fore Lib."
20513,Now this Oath will hinder the alteration of the Church Go∣vernment to a better.
20514,For being once sworn to: Melius non mutabis pejus.
20515,"Christs Kingdome must be kept out,  and wayes of proceeding be establi∣shed in the Church, and that by an Oath."
20516,"If the Book of Com∣mon Prayer would better the Discipline, and doe much wish therefore to have publique Penance restored, this Oath con∣tradicts it, and tells us that we have all the Discipline is need∣full to Salvation, and that the Government by right ought to stand a now it stands."
20517,"But there are great grievances, dreadfull disor∣ders, and horrible corruptions in the Discipline and Govern∣ment of the Church, as now it stands; and men should rather sweare to indeavour their utmost to get them removed in this approaching Parliament, then give consent to have them un∣alterd one day longer: as  at  ex Officio, Ca∣nonicall obedience, reading of Apocrypha Books, abuse of Excommu∣nication, the exorbitant power of  in all their Courts, changing times and seasons for Marriage at their pleasure, hindring Preaching and praying where they list, imposing new and unlawfull things upon the Mi∣nistry, illegally outing them from their livings, &c. The proceed∣ing yet in many things by the Popes Canon Law; the taking a∣way the power of the keyes from the Pastors of particular Congre∣gations, and setting up Chancellors over them and their flocks, putting into Laymens hands (for a Chancellor is no other) the  are much cryed out of, and condemn'd by us in the Scottish and Forraigne Churches, and yet we set and hold them up at home with both hands."
20518,"The Bishop delegates his power to the Chancellour, and so the sentence of Excommunication is devolv'd upon a meere Lay∣man, which dealing with Presbyterians, we say is incompatible to a Lay-man: and what is this, but to destroy with the hand what we bind with the tongue."
20519,"Neither is that shift avayle∣able to say,  because he is but os Canceliarij, the mouth of the Chancellour, to pronounce what he decrees: who can stoppe it if not pro∣nounc'd call it out of the Ministers hand, and must give the Asolution if pronounced, and so the whole power lyes still in the Chancellors hand."
20520,"If these things therefore and diverse other were altered, we should not abjure them, but thinke our selves bound by right and Conscience to intertaine them."
20521,"Againe, this Oath appeares further to be unlawfull."
20522,"First, be∣cause it doth insuare our Consciences, and takes away the liber∣ty of them, binding us not so much as to consent unto any al∣teration, although it should be in the judgement of all farre better then what we have."
20523,"Secondly, it doth make us vassals and bondslaves to the Prelary, we must be their sworn Subjects, and tye our selvs by Oath to uphold their tottering Kingdome."
20524,"And if the Prelacie have its pedegree from Rome, as some of themselves me, what is this Oath but a policie to setch in our shoulders so support Antichrist and his Government?"
20525,"what is it but the plain marke of the Beast, which some make to be an Oath, and others a submitting to his power, and acknowledging of him to be Lord, Med in Comment."
20526,Here is both an Oath and an absolute unto the and acknowledg∣ing of them to be .
20527,"By this Oath free become , which contrary to the Petiton of Right, 30."
20528,"It is an and perpetuating of humane and for the whole Hierarchie mention'd in the Oath, from Arch-bishops to the end of the &c. are sufficiently known to be moore Ecclesiasticall Constitutions, and subject to such coruptions from time to time, as may necessitate an altert∣ion."
20529,"Are there not such oule corruptions now amongst them, as er mightily to the Parliament for alteration, and without re∣dresse will sinke the whole Kingdome."
20530,What safety or then hath any man to sweare these Constitutions into an in∣rable condition.
20531,"It's a condemg of all other Reformed Churches: They have not our Discipline, and yet we have given them the right hand of fellowship,  And if we sweare this Discipline to be necessary to Salvat, we must condemne them as wanting somthing necessary thereunte: It's little lesse then to unchurch, and to pronounce them to be without that Discipline which is Essentiall to the beeing of a true Church; and they may charge us with falsifying the 20th and , Ach, which teach, that things belonging to Government and Disipline are alterable; and so much is expressed in the Title of Ceremonies before the Book of Common Prayer."
20532,"Because by this Oath the Prelates are invested with a which neither God nor the Laws of the Kingdome ever gave them; as namely, upon refusall of this wretched Oath, they will deprive any painfull conscientious and faithfull Minister of all his Ecclesiascall promotions whatsoever, and of the execution of his Function, which is directly against Law, for if Pastors be Le∣gally possess'd of their hvings, what injustice is it to make after-Canons and Oaths to question and throw them out of their right."
20533,This Synod had not our consents and suffrages for the Clerks of it.
20534,Those were legally chosen had voyce no longer in the Convocation house then the Parliament indured.
20535,"There being ther∣fore no new elction of Clerks, nor any new Writ to legitimate those, but onely a new Commission to goe on with what was begun in Parliament but nul by breach thereof, being out that Commission the space of a whole weeke, as by the date thereof, May 12. we cannot but jdge both Oath and Canons to be illegall."
20536,"The Oath implyes a plain contradiction, and that which is ."
20537,"It requires me to Sweare sincerely, without any secret reservation, and an &c. in it, which imports more then is expre, and necessiaces a mentall conception, and 8."
20538,"We are bound to take it heartily, and willingly, which no man that hath any consideration or conscience can doe."
20539,"For it's against truth, and obligeth to sweare a falsehood,  which is not true of Chancellours, Commissaries, Offalls, &c. nor of Bishops proceeding in their Courts in their own names, and under their own Seales."
20540,"It s against judgement, including a con∣tradiction, as appeares in the 7th particular: It's against righte∣ousnes, because both the Parliament, the Prince and Pastors them∣selves are perjured by it, as hath formerly bin shewn; and it's a swearing up a corrupt, if not an Antichristian Government over the People."
20541,Besides this Oath is backed with severe punishment.
20542,"Refusall of it brings  Hence many that are poore and weake it's to be feared) will take the Oath, reluctante conscientia, and to save their Livings, forsweare themselves."
20543,This Oath is full of ambiguities.
20544,"The Doctrine of the Church is not clearely known, the Homilies have been dis∣claim'd."
20545,"The Articles are challenged by the Armians and o∣thers, to be for them."
20546,"It's doubtfull to us whether a great part of Scripture be not excluded as unnecessary, because much of the Scripture is neither verbaily expressed, nor vertually included in the publique Declaration of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England, and that they are said to containe all things necessary to salvation: we are doubtfull of the Disci∣pline, because much depends upon the interpretation of the Or∣dinary, which is unknown: and yearely differing Articles are composed for Visitations."

20554,"It being thus, who can sweare without equivocation?"
20555,"Lastly, no man taking this Oath can well acquit himselfe of perjury, for if he take it in the plain common sense and understand∣ing of the words, yet there must be some mentall reservation in the words &c. and equivocation in the minds of Hyerarchicall men touching those words by right: for though they should venture to sweare Prelates into a jus divinum, yet they dare not sweare Deanes and Archdeacons into it, and so must sweare in a double sense, and perjure themselves But all this may be help∣ed by our own interpretations and protestations.Perjurisunt qui¦id quod falsum esse sciunt, aut putant jura∣mento confir∣ment."

20558,"And the Oath▪ it selfe binds us to take it in the common sense of the words If we then take the Oath: and protest against such and such senses, and make a sense of our own, this is direct and wilfull perjury said Civilians And the protestation be∣ing made before a publique notary, this shalbe sufficient evidence in any Cout of the Kingdome to convict us of the perjury If then any of the Prelater have taken this Oath in its proper sense, or a sense of their own, how have they perjur'd themselvs, propham'd their hands, and put in a barre against their future conferring of holy Orders."

20569,"That is to say, the Sundayes next following Easter day and Saint Michael tharchanell, or on some other Sunday within one moneth after those feastes, immediatly after the Gospell."
20570,"FOrasmuch as it appertaineth to all Christian men, but especially to the ministers and the pastours of the Church, being teachers & instructers of others, to be ready to giue a rea∣son of their faith when they shalbe thereunto required: I for my part nowe appointed your Parson, Vicar, or Curate, hauing before mine eyes the feare of God, & the testimo∣nie of my conscience, do acknowledge for my selfe, and require you to assent to the same."
20571,"i Fyrst that there is but one liuing and true God, of infinite power, wisedome, & good∣nesse, the maker and preseruer of all things, and that in vnitie of this Godhead, there be three persons of one substance, of equall power and eternitie, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost."
20572,"ii I beleeue also whatsoeuer is conteined in the holy Canonicall Scriptures, in the which Scriptures are conteined all things necessarie to saluation, by the which also al errours & heresies may sufficiently be reproued and conuicted, and all doctrine and Articles necessarie to saluation establyshed."
20573,"I do also most firmely beleeue and confesse all the Articles conteined in the three Creedes: the Nicene Creede, Athana∣sius Creede, and our common Creede, called the Apostles Creede: for these do briefly conteine the princi∣pall Articles of our faith, which are ar large set forth in the holy Scriptures."
20574,"iii I acknowledge also that Church to be the spouse of Christ, wherein the word of God is truly taught, the Sacraments orderly ministred according to Christes institution, and the authoritie of the keys duely vsed."
20575,"And that euery such particular Church hath authoritie to institute, to change, & cleane to put away Ceremonies and other Ecclesiasticall rites, as they be superfluous, or be abused, and to constitute other, making more to seemelynesse, to order, or edification."

20578,"vi Moreouer, touching the Byshop of Rome, I do acknowledge and confesse, that by the Scriptures and word of God, he hath no more authoritie then other Byshops haue in their prouinces and diocesses: And therefore ye power which he now challengeth, that is, to be ye supreme head of the vniuersall Church of Christ, and so to be aboue all Emperours, Kinges, and Princes, is an vsurped power, contrary to the Scriptures and worde of God, and contrary to the example of the primitiue Church."
20579,"And therefore is for most iust causes taken away, and abolyshed within this Realme."
20580,"vii Furthermore I do graunt and confesse, that the booke of common prayer & administration of the holy Sacraments, set forth by authoritie of parliament, is agreeable to the Scriptures, & that it is Ca∣tholike, Apostolike, & most for the aduauncing of Gods glory, and the edifying of Gods people, both for that it is in a tongue that may be vnderstanded of the people, and also for the doctrine and fourme of mi∣nistration contained in the same."

20583,"ix Moreouer I do not onely acknowledge, that priuate masses were neuer vsed amongst the fathers of the primitiue Church, I meane publike ministration & receiuing of the Sacrament by the priest alone, without a iust number of communicants, according to Christes saying, Take ye, and eate ye, &c. but also that the doctrine, which maintaineth the masse to be a propitiatorie sacrifice for the quicke and the dead, and a meane to deliuer soules out of purgatorie, is neyther agreeable to Christs ordinance, nor grounded vpon doctrine Apostolike, but contrarywise most vngodly & most iniurious to the precious redemption of our Sauiour Christ, and his onely sufficient sacrifice offered once for euer vpon the altar of the crosse."
20584,"x I am of that minde also, that the holy Communion or Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, for the due obedience to Christes institution, and to expresse the vertue of the same, ought to be ministred vn∣to the people vnder both kindes, & that it is auouched by certaine fathers of the Church, to be a plaine sa∣criledge to robbe them of the mysticall cup, for whom Christ hath shed his most precious bloud: Seing he him selfe hath said, Drinke ye all of this."

20586,"yeeres after Christ and more, both the partes of the Sacrament were ministred to the people."
20587,"Last of all, as I do vtterly disalowe the extolling of Images, Relickes, and fayned myracles, and al∣so all kindes of expressing God inuisible, in the fourme of an olde man, or the holy Ghost, in fourme of a Doue, and all other vaine worshipping of God, deuised by mans fantasie, besides or contrary to ye Scrip∣tures: (as wandring on pilgrimages, setting vp of candles, praying vpon beades, & such like superstition,) which kinde of workes haue no promise of reward in scripture, but contrarywise threatnings and male∣dictions: So I do exhort all men to the obedience of Gods lawe, and to the woorkes of faith, as charitie, mercie, pitie, almes, deuout and feruent prayer with thaffection of the heart, & notwith the mouth one∣ly, godly abstinence & fasting, chastitie, obedience to the rulers & superiour powers, with such like works and godlynes of life, commaunded by God in his word: which as Saint Paul saith, hath promises both of this life, and of the life to come, and are workes onely acceptable in Gods sight."

20617,"THe essentiall poynts thereof seem to be the advantages, and disadvantages of such an alli∣ance, and whether both weighed in equall bal∣lance, the one will not oversway the other."
20618,The advantages that England may pretend are these.
20619,"First, a great Kings daughter."
20620,"Secondly, much mony."
20621,"Thirdly, safety."
20622,"Fourthly, continuance of trade."
20623,"Fiftly, the bridling of the overgrowing greatnes of the States."
20624,"Sixtly, the Subiects of Spain will not be se bur∣thensome to England being more remote, as those of France would be that are nearer neighbours."
20625,"Lastly, hindring the Scottish faction for strength∣ning it selfe by the alliance of France, which though it be not publickly taken knowledge of, yet hath his place among the reasons that further the match with Spaine."
20626,These and the like benefits and advantages some promise to themselues by running the course of Spaine: but of God or his cause hitherto is made noe mention at all.
20627,"And yet vnlesse the Lord build the house, the builders labour but in vaine."
20628,"The Answer The meanest of the houshould of faith are much greater then those that are without, for they are borne to a great inheritance: these are their promises."
20629,"First God is their God, and with them hath he made a covenant: nor ought it to be forgotten that the house of Spayn is stained with incest in the match with the last King & his owne sisters daughter, which cannot be but very loathsome to every true Christians hart: and yet to speake according to the world, the estate of England is great enough of it selfe match it where it will, as it hath done in times past, and as other great Monarkes haue led the way."
20630,"And the alliance of France is neere, and hath no ill aspect upon England, and is as honourable as that of Spain; that of France will not proue so beneficiall, and so neither so dangerous or prejudiciall."
20631,"Secōdly, mony wil be soon wasted and melted away, but the price of it will abide still: and let not any flat∣er themselues, Spayn giveth nothing but for some∣thing, and where he giveth much he looketh for a great returne: Examine well their actions and pro∣ceedings and make use of experience: whether can or ought mony to be an essentiall consideration to sway the weight of so important an Alliance."
20632,"Thirdly, is not England stronger at this time and Spain weaker then heretofore?"
20633,where then is any cause of feare?
20634,But alow that the state of England stood in feare of any danger of Spayn?
20635,will this al∣liance secure them?
20636,"the feare is idle and the remedy more idle, unlesse any could make it good that the love of Spayne unto England (the match going for∣ward) would proue the predominant humor in him, that should sway his ambission, whereof the world hath so much experience to the contrary."
20637,Charles the fift gaue his owne sister in mariage to Francis the first: was Francis ever a whit the safer for such an alliance?
20638,"Savoy hath married Spaines sister, who nevertheles doth what he can to swalow him up."
20639,"France and Spaine haue lastly made a double match, ler it be examined whether Spaine hath laboured more to quench or kindle the fier in France; and yet they are both of one and the same religion."
20640,"They erre who thinke there is any thinge to be had from a Papist for love rather then for feare, or that Spaine will ever dessist from aspiring to the universal Monarchy of Christondome, and particularly the re∣covery of the uuited provinces: for though he often strike saile and put into the harbour in fowle weather yet doth he not neglect to weigh anchour againe, and follow his intended course when the season is fit for it."
20641,"England doth hinder his designes; and therefore would he match with England to haue the fitter pas∣sage for him: and if he were in quiet posession of all the seventeene Provinces, then would they be made a stable or store-house for all things necessary, in so plentifull and well fitted a situation, for the invading the parts neare adioyning, whereof the plots are not new, if England give way unto him, then (disapoin∣ted of their defences and Bulwarkes) they will stand (as it were) at his mercy and ly open to all manner of batteries: as on the other side if he be crossed, then will things be but where they vvere, both for conti∣nuance and assurance against fear of invasion; nay ra∣ther in so much the worse termes, because he shall faile of his expectation, which commonly breeds much harshnes even amongst the dearest freinds."
20642,"Let not any cast a mist in others eyes: though Spain had left aside his wonted ambition (which none can suf∣ficiently assure) yet will he never loose his hope, or relent in his resolution of recovering the united Pro∣vinces, wherein his honour and his reputation are so deeply interessed: nor can such a great scattered bo∣dy that hath so many irons in the fier be but conti∣nually armed, and still in action to the danger both of freinds and foes, as he shall finde his best advanta∣ges and oportunities."
20643,"If England fear Spain, their safety will rather stand in keeping him at the staves end then in receaving such an ambitious and new reconciled enemy and doubtfull frend into their bosom, where he shall vvithout blovves be able to doe them much more hurt by his daily practice and corrupting of the sub∣iects, then he can otherwise by open hostility, which he will be wary enough not to attempt, lest they ioyning their foarces by sea with those of the united Provinces, should giue him too great a shake."
20644,"Strange intelligence, and corespondence with neighbour friends and allies will alwayes proue a safer refuge for England against Spain."
20645,"And because all haue a com∣mon quarrell to his Ambition and greatnes, which in him will never giue way to any other consideration whatsoever: for there hath ever been and will still continue in Spain an endlesse ambitious desire of the obtayning the westerne Monarchy vvhere of a greate parte of Christendome doth yet beare the scarre, and feele the stripes."
20646,Trade will be allowed to continue and as safely without the Alliance of Marriage as with it: for Spayn doth not only reape a benefit by it; but also will be afrayde to scare or discontent England by the evill usage of the Marchants.
20647,"Else why haue they so basely and abjectly begged a peace: whēsoever he shall se his opportunity and finde a greater aduantage to break then to continue in good termes with England, the Alliance vvill secure the merchants no more, then if it were not at all."
20648,"The states may in time grow great, and their greatnes may grow dangerous; but Spayn is both the one and the other already; and this Alliance will ad much unto it: there may also grow yealousy and un∣kindnes and thence open emnity betwixt England and them, and so on the other side may the matter be so discreetly caried, as they two may entertaine good amity and correspōdency one with the other for common defence: for they both professe one religion and their estate and condition seemes to unite them together in a necessity of putting out their hands one to another for mutuall preservation."
20649,Doe they carry themselves now unkindly or some∣what unrespectiuly?
20650,"It doth not so urgently prove that they may become enemies hereafter, as there upon to ground a necessity of making an Alliance with a known enemy, which were no other but to run into a present mischeif for fear of a future incon∣venience."
20651,"They take an Allarum at Englands ioyning with Spayn to their hurt; which though it be not so ment by England, yet it is the scope that Spayn aymes at and that may make them perhaps somewhat to neglect England, but remoue the cause, and the effect will cease, let them be assured of their freindship and they will prove respectfull freinds: if they prosper and grow great, who knoweth whether it be not of God, by such weake meanes to pull downe the loftines of Spayn?"
20652,"and then to withstand them were to run a∣gainst a rock: the very first occasion of their liberty was driving them to dispaire; which made them to take hart and resolution to resist the violence that was offered: wherein being incoraged with good suc∣cesse, and feeling their owne strength, they haue in time made such further progresse as is this day to be seene: better it were for England to make use of a ne∣cessary evill, and run a course with them whereby they may haue their part in their well speeding, then to ioyne with Spayn (a religion and state enimy) who Allieth him selfe to England but for his ovvne ends, and must needes draw after them the over∣throw of the cause of religion and ruine the state: and will never proue but a secrett Enimy and doubtfull frend."
20653,"And it must not in this place be forgotten that if true professors be justly reproved for going to law before heathen Iudges, much lesse may they side themselves with any of those that are without, to the hinderance and hurt one of an other."
20654,"If England and Fraunce should match to∣gether, it doth not therefore consequently follow that the French should become burthensome to the State by reason of their nearnesse."
20655,The lawes of England allow no offices or preferments of ali∣ens.
20656,The french will haue more hope in their owne Cuntry where there is without comparison more to be given then in England; the English seeke not to make any fortune in Scotland.
20657,"But if the French should be importunate they are also impatient: let them finde Visage de Boyes, and your couldnes should weare out their earnestnes."
20658,"That the French with the Scottish faction may gather strength by the Alliance of France is but a par∣ticular consideration: against which may be opposed the greatnes the Spanish faction will grovv unto by a match vvith Spayn to the danger of the state: this doth greatly lay open the value of such advantages as England doth promise it selfe by matching with Spain vvhich how dearely they vvould notvvithstanding be bought will more perfectly appeare, if knowledg be also taken of the inconveniences and mischeifes that vvould follovv: for the better conceiving vvhere of, his ends are to be considered, and seriously examined; for it is not likely that Spain a Religion and State Ca∣tholique, vvho hath both religion and state quarrels against England, vvill yeald to giue his Daughter in Mariage to England: nay rather doth offer great sums of mony for composing there of; but that he looks for a great returne, Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes."
20659,"The price of this Alliance therefore vvill be the breaking of the match vvith France, to the vveakning of both England ane Fraunce, vvhereby he may have the greater footing in eyther, and the deviding Eng∣land from his alices, especially from the States of the united Porovinces, the making vvay for an other match for his second sonne (vvhom he hath a plot to settle in the lovv Cuntries, and from thence to promote him (if he can) to the Crovvne Imperiall) vvith an other daughter of France, vvhich vvould giue so great an Allarum to the vvhole state of those of the religion, if the pretended match vvith Eng∣land come not betvveen, altering in time the state of Religion, vvhereof if he had no hope, neither vvould he harken to the match: for none must thinke he vvould treat such an Alliance vvithout the privacy and consent of his divines, or that they vvill giue their consents to that but upon great probability that it shall tend to the furtherance of their catholique faith."
20660,"The supposed Catholique religion is knovvne to be in Spain one of the fundamentall Lavves of their estate: and no doubt Spain is a very right Romish Catholique, the further therefore that he spreadeth his religion, the greater satisfaction it is to his consci∣ence, and the more doth he underprop and increase his greatnes, namely because those of that religion that are most deuout, but especially the greatest part of the Clergy throughout Christendom haue their eyes fixed on him, as upon the greatest stay and piller of their catholique faith: vvho therefore if he should match vvith an heritique (for so they terme us Eng∣lish) but vvith a setled purpose by such meanes to root out heresy, vvould both vvrong his ovvne con∣science, and loose his reputation amongst all those of his beleefe, to the over great vveakning of his estate: vvhich error none of sound judgment that knovves Spayn, vvill easily beleve that he vvill commit."
20661,"That a change or tolleration should happen in England by meanes of the intended match, is more to be feared then any can vvarrant to be impossible: vvherin it vvere vvell vvorth the laboure to find out vvhat hope Spayn doth ground upon, and vvhat pos∣sibility there is that the same may be disapoynted; in the mean time very likely it is in generall that there vvill be no meanes unattempted, or left on his side, to bring his purpose to passe."
20662,"And then it must in this place be remembred, first that vvhatsoever is not of fayth is sin, and that sin hath no promise of blessing; nor is this a vvork of fayth."
20663,"And next that England hath but too much experience of Popery, vvith in these fevv yeares, for vvant of due executi∣on of the Lavves; vvhich hath bread exceeding great bouldnes in the papists, asvvell at home as abroad."
20664,"If the mariage goe forvvard they vvill take the more hart and greater encouragement, no small number of subiects want teaching, and so are the more easily shaken, many waver, and many are newfangled the more prepared for a chaunge: & therefore will accor∣dingly be wrought upon."
20665,"The ould serpent will se∣duce many Eves, and pistols will have free passage e∣very where."
20666,"The worst is yet, that there will be par∣ty children: for the mother will give herselfe noe rest till she have nusled some of them in her owne religiō, which would make the way very playn & easy for a chaunge, because the head once corrupted, the infection will in short time spread it selfe over the whole body, and true religion is unsociable to sort it selfe with false worship, and will soone forsake his dwelling place."
20667,"If Spayn can procure a tolleration of religion (vvhich must needs be follovved vvith ruine of the State) he may then assure himselfe of sides that vvill alvvayes be able either directly or indirectly to divert the state from hindering his designes▪ as vvell in the lovv Cuntryes, as vvheresoever else, and although he should not prevayle at the first by practis, or procure a tolleration of religion, vvhich neverthelesse the in∣creacing number of Papists will of it selfe in processe of time effect, yet when he hath once a faction on foote and that many of the subjects are perverted in religion, he will notwithstanding be in good hope that the state may be stayed, & hindered frō opposing it self against his designes by the working of his factiō & the ielousy that will be cōceaved of the Papists with∣in the Relme: and whether his hopes will fayll him or no, yet if he should upon such ground make any attempt against those of the united Provinses, that could not but fale out to the great troble annoyance and danger of the state, especially if he send his forses by sea; for then must England upon any such occati∣on either rig out there Navy to sea to se that he keep his course, which will allwayes be a matter of great burthen and charge, or otherwayes abide the danger of his landing upon their owne cousts, if he have intelligence with the Papists: wherefore it will be allwayes safer in such cases to be somewhat iealous then too secure."
20668,"Now the Alliance with Spayn vvill not onely scarr and discourage in generall, the vvholl side of those of the religion abroad, to the great vveakning of the state of England, but also breed a particuler ielousy in those of the united Provinses, vvhen they shall se that Popery increaseth, or that Spayn hath a faction▪ or party in the Relme: vvhereof one of these tvvo mischeives must consequently follovv, either that they will make their peace vvith Spayn, or keep con∣tinually many shipes of vvar in the narrovv seas if they be able to hould out, especially upon the com∣ming of any supplyes by sea to the Artch Duke during the Truce: vvhich (as they are a people iealous and suspitious enough by nature) may at one time or o∣ther by occationes happening grovv to some dan∣gerous inconvenience: for betvveen tvvo so neare neighbours both potent at sea, if there be not straight amity kept, things cannot long stand vvithout break∣ing forth into tearmes of open hostility."
20669,"And for the state of those Provinses, though strong by sea, Alli∣ance, and cituation, yet are not the foundations of it so far sure that England can vvith safety leaue them to themselves▪ for the late sects and questions about matters of religion threaten their disunion; and Spayn that lies continually in wayt for their liberty hath his pencioners and dayly practicers amongst them."
20670,"Some doe noyse much the antient amity with the house of Burgundy, but that house is changed and hath not kept strok in the conditions of the Alliance, & so ought the cause to be altered too."
20671,"It was to weak for France but now it is too strong, and England had then plots against France which now it hath not▪ The greatest use of Leagues and Alliances is to pre∣vent present mischeives, or to further some necessary enterprice: otherwise reason of state and common experience teacheth to sway even with the vveaker, for the brideling of the ambition and greatnes of the stronger."
20672,"They make an idle distinction vvho to a∣voyd the obiections made against Spayn pretend that mariages are but personall amongst Preinces and not reall: for if there be no reallity, vvhere is then the good of England?"
20673,if there be any who is so weak as to thinke that Spayn will easily quit his interest in it.
20674,"To alledge the exampell of Erance that houldeth correspondency still vvith his other Allies, and con∣tinues to assist them against Sapyn, (notvvithstanding his match vvith Spayn) is to as litle purpose in the judgment of those vvho doe also knovv hovv much Spayn prevayleth in weakning their sinewes, and frus∣trating the effect of such assistance."
20675,"The sum is, that Spayn hopes by reason of this match so to charme England, as it shall give way to him in his courses: and England contrariwise promiseth it selfe the hony of the bee without danger of being stung: whether of both may come short of their rec∣coning is at the least disputable."
20676,"For Spayn on the one side will spare no travell or charge, will use all the meanes and practises he can, and take the bene∣fit of all occasions, and advantages that shall be offe∣red to bring his purposes to passe: as it may be suppo∣sed that England for his part will stand upon his watch, to prevent a mischeife that shall threaten the state."
20677,"Spayn may (by a vigilant care and good foresight) be disapoynted: so may England by the contrary be overtaken: for death will weare away these watch∣men that are now, and others may succeed that will not be so watchfull: nay watchfulnes it selfe over∣watched will in time grow drowsy, and overwearied carefulnes will grow carelesse."
20678,The very best cautions and caveats must needes relent and wax ould in time.
20679,"In all strife and con∣tentions as well of the body as the mind, if one side get ground the other looseth it."
20680,"Time will bring forth many accidents which may fall out as to the good, so to the hurt of England: who (that may with good reason be feared) will not be watchfull nor have his spirits alwayes intent enough to pre∣vent the practises of Spayn after so straite Alliance, that cannot now so much as foresee them, or resolue to keep out Spayn."
20681,"Whereupon the question ariseth whether it be a sound course for England (not con∣strayned by any urgent necessity) to put the cause of religion, and their owne well doing and safety to so great an adversary, in a matter that stands upon so ma∣ny contingents."
20682,"For it is no new experience that the things which we think almost impossible, and there∣fore fear them least, doe neverthelesse often come to passe; because neglected, and so not hindered by opposition, they creep unawares upon us as through the mists of security."
20683,"Well saith the Italian there∣fore  To conclude, Spayn who of late was thought to de∣cline, weak in the head, and wounded in reputation by those of the united Provinces; yet having never been more weakly ballanced then at this present, begins now to resume his spirits, and without timely and strong opposition, will take so deep roote, and spread his branches so far, as to overshadow all his neighbours: and deadly dangerouse it will be for any one to sleepe in such a shade."

20978,"Because I hold, it is the greatest gaine To die well: For we no man truely call Or rich, or happie, till his Funerall."

20980,"R. C. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, WILLIAM, LORD MAYNARD, MY very good Lord."
20981,"TO whom should I these pleasing paines commend, My Muse hath ane Frugality to trade?"
20982,"But to the Muses deare and noble friend, Who, as in Honour, seekes to thriue in Grace: Who, truly nobe, honoureth his Place; Nor fr his Place is onely honoured: Whom should the Muses more desire to grace, Then whom they haue vp in their Bosomes bred, And who with bountous gifts them ath reguerdoned?"
20983,"Such Bounty is true Thrift: Thus thou dost lay Thy treasure vp in heau'n; thus thou dost gaine: By giuing of some fading goods away, True honour, which for euer shall remaine: If thou wilt pleased be to entertaine Thrift and her traine, into thy Patronage, I boldly dare in her behalfe maintaine, Shee is faire, bounteous, sober, graue and sage, And fit to counsell thee, in Youth, in Strength, and Age."
20984,"Next, Prouidence shall guide thee and , In all wherein hand is diligent, And holy Care and Labour shall direct Thy Counsels to a iust and good , To hau'n of Rest, to harbour of Content: And if thou please to reade Deaths Meditation, Thou shalt perceiue her as an Herald sent, To summon thee to heau'nly habitation, To blessed Bride and Bridegroomes marriage-consummation: Most happy end of all, that rightly runne Their courses in the dayes of vanity!"
20985,"With Wisedomes study Solomon begun, But ends all with this Epithalamic: Sweet Swan-like Farewell of Mortality!"
20986,Taste of true Ioy which euer shall remaine!
20987,"Then know, it is thy highest Dignitie, This Earnest sure, of heau'n on earth, to gaine; Which I will pray for, Thou must labour to attayne."
20988,"Your Lordships most deuoted in all affectionate duty and seruice, Robert Aylet."
20989,"Of Frugality, or Thrift."
20990,"MY Muse now fares like some plaine country Mayd, Walking in fairest Garden for delight, With all variety and choyce arrayd, Of herbs and flowers to please the Sent & Sight; Who with the choycest flowers doth first bedight White silken pillowes of her bosome faire; But after their rich colours her inuite, With them to decke her head and golden haire, That as she them adornes, so they may all begay her."
20991,"For when Brides garden first I entered Of Graces, for delightfull meditation, I onely some choyce Flowers gathered, For holy Life, and heau'nly Contemplation: But passing foorth with choyce of Delectation, Such sweet and rich variety I find, Fit to adorne my life and conuersation, Out of those pleasant knots I cannot wind, Which with new choyce of flowres & herbs delight my mind."
20992,"But amongst all the fragrant herbes and flowers, That in the Graces garden doe abound, I find none of more sou'raigne grace and powers, Than this of Thrift, which next I do propound: An herbe indeed that's hardly to be found, Because she most what in a corner growes, And matteth low vpon the fattest ground, And many her mistake for likely showes, But scarce one of an hundred that her truly knowes."
20993,Oh heau'nly Muse!
20994,"that taught the shepherds swaine, (As he his flockes was following great with yong, To feed them on faire Iordans flowrie plaine) Diuinest skill in Tunes and heau'nly Song; With some such holy Fury touch my tong, Whilst I now of Frugality do sing; Who, though she little doth to me belong, Yet if thou help to touch my harsher string, I may teach some her practice, whilst her praise I ring."
20995,"She is that Vertue, or that golden Meae, 'Twixt Auarice and Frodigalitie, The constant Moderation betweene Base Niggardize, and wasting Luxury."
20996,"We Temprance, Abstinence, and Modesy, With Continence, in this word THRIFT contain; And yet exclude not Liberality."
20997,"Who doth to name of frugi frugall man attaine, One of the highest Titles due to man doth gaine."
20998,"And such indeed haue onely right fruition Of all such fruits, as God to man doth send; Who prudently here weighing their condition, Preserue the Substance, and the fruits do spend: Who flockes and cattell diligently tend, Grasse, Vines and Corn that in the fields do grow, To them their lambes for clothing, Wooll will lend; From Goats and Kine great store of milke shal flow, To feed their houshold, and large gifts abroad bestow."
20999,"There is a Thrift in Substance, and in Grace; One temporall, the other spirituall: They that the one, without the other, trace, Do neither of them find perpetuall: God is of both the Cause effectuall; Apolo water, Paul may plant and sow, But God it is that work to all in all: As all spirituall Thrift from him doth flow, So, by his blessing all in substance thriue and grow."
21000,"This did theLaban Churle by good experience proue, So long as he good Iacob could retaine, He saw great blessings come from heau'n aboue, And therefore sought him ay to entertaine: Whilst Ioseph with th' Egyptian doth remaine, All prospers in his house, and in his field, And in the prison h doth fauour gaine, Because all well succeeds that he doth wield: By heau'ns sweet influence the earth her fruits doth yeeld."
21001,"Thrift eldest daughter is of Temperance, By Prudence nursed in her tender yeeres, But when to riper yeeres she doth aduance, A Standard vnder Fortitude she beares: Shee, graced by these three most noble Peeres, By their aduice directs her actions right, By Temperance she feedes, and cloathing weares; By Prudence store prouides with wise foresight; By Fortitude 'gainst Fortunes blasts she stands vpright."
21002,"She moderateth all delights and pleasure, Not that she vs forbids all sports or play, But makes vs recreate our selues with measure, That from our selues they take vs not away: As he that moderates, vpon the way His iercer Steed, is said to vse him right; Not he that let's him runne about and stray: So onely he doth pleasures vse aright, That serues not them, but makes them serue to his delight."
21003,"For she not onely is a Moderation In meates, and what to clothing doth pertaine, But she eke moderates our recreation, Lest for it we do lose a greater gaine: She doth too much of any thing refraine, And cuts off all luxurious vaine expence."
21004,"If thou to thrift and riches wouldst attaine Here, seeke not to increase and raise thy rents, But moderate Desire, and vaine Concupiscence."
21005,"I euer from Frugalitie exclude All sordid basenesse, want of aliment, She out of plenty alwaies doth seclude Some few things necessary for Content: For to be frugall and magnificent, May both well in a prudent man combine, Else Thrift no daughter is of Temperment; I onely those for frugall men define, Who vse their store, but suffer it not to decline."
21006,"I oft do find in some a simulation, Or ostentation of Frugality; When great men follow thriftie imitation Of those, which are of meaner qualitie: And this may be too much Rusticitie, Be it in Diet, Vessels, Ornament; Best rule for Thrift in all, is Modesty: For where it meetes with one that's prouident, Hee's temp'rate, modest, frugall and magnificent."
21007,"But the most deare and faithfull friend to Thrift, Is carefull Husbandry, and Prouidence: This is the thriuing Vertue, which is grift On stocke of Labour, Care, and Diligence."
21008,"This brings in sewell to Magnificence, And like good huswife fetcheth food from farre."
21009,"The thriftie handmaid of Beneficence, In Summer for the Winter taketh care; And, ere she builds, Materials doth abroad prepare."
21010,"Fye on the lazie Grasopper, that sings All Summer, and in Winter sterues for cold, Vnlike the frugall Pismire, which still brings In new prouision, ere she spend her old: Like many youthfull Gallants, who their gold, In summer of their youth do sport away; But when their coyne is spent, and land is sold, Too lae, find Ryo cause of their decay: But prudent Thrift foresees and shunnes such euill day."
21011,"By ciuill Law, the madde and prodigall Are interdicted the administration Of their owne Goods; and haue Curators all, To manage their estate in frugall fashion: And so long must they both abide Curation; The furious till he gets his wits againe, The Prodigall, till he to emendation Doth of his Manners and his Thrift attaine: 'Tis good for Common-wealth, none spend his state in vaine."
21012,"One, Thrift vnto the Temples doth compare Amongst the Heathen, which, most sure Asyle, And Sanctuaries for all Debtors were: Another likes a thrifty man, ere-while, To ground wel compast, and wel till'd with toyle: For as such lands grow foule by slothfulnesse, But fruitfull, where the plough doth stir the soyle: So men grow grosse and foule by Idlenesse, But pure and healthfull by laborious Thriftinesse."
21013,"Heathen, such fruitfull frugall men compare Vnto the gods, who had so little need, Though they had all, that they it all could spare To mortals, who did here their blessings need: Farre otherwise 'tis with our rich-mens breed; They nothing spare, but spend eu'n all and more, Their Flesh and Lusts luxuriously to feed: Thus they, in plenty swimming, are but poore, When those that haue but little, yet haue greater store."
21014,"This their rich misery doth not proceed From any fault, that is in outward store, But from Lusts and Cupidities which breed In Soule and Body, as I said before: Like some in fits of Agues, who the more Coole Beere they drink, the more they do desire, Their drinking thirst increaseth: He therefore Must purge the humours, cause of all this Fire, Else drinke till he burst, he growes within the drier."
21015,"Me thinkes I rightly may this Thrift compare Vnto the seu'n at Kine on Nylus shore, Or those seu'n goodly ares of Corne, which were To Egypts Monarch signes of Thrift and store: The blasted eares, and Bullockes leane and poore, I liken vnto Prodigality: Who all the fruits deuowers vp, and more, That are prouided by Frugality: Thus she with her owne bowels feeds her enemy."
21016,"As when the Ayer suckes immoderatly Vp moysture from the ground, the clouds do fall From thence againe on Earth most lauishly: Eu'n so, when Misers here do licke vp all, For to enrich their heyers therewithall, Soone as the long-expected day doth come Of their most welcome, tearelesse funerall, Their wealth all lauishly about doth run, Till their rich cloud be spent, and they be quite vndone."
21017,"It is most terrible, prodigious, To see an Earthquake, with dread violence, Swallow a Country, City, Towne, or House; Yet Prodigals, oft by profuse expence, Do swallow Towers, Houses, Farms and Rents: Then they, saith one, them vomit vp againe, Not truly sell them; for they haue long since Them spent in drinking, lusts and pleasures vaine; They onely now are faint to spue them out for paine."
21018,"Many good precepts find I of the wise, Vs to instruct in true Frugality; But Dauid doth the onely way aduise, In his most sweet diuinest Psalmody: He shall haue plenty and prosperity, That feares the Lord, and scatters to the poore, His name be blessed to Posterity."
21019,He that disperseth shall haue greater store: For goods-disposer giues him all his wealth therefore.
21020,"Abels first frugall man I of do reade, Who gaue the fairest firstlings of his Flockes, Because there was no poore that then had need, To him that gaue him all his store and stockes."
21021,"This gaue to Isaac great and castie Shockes, When in one yeere he reapt an hundred-fold: Iacob, that went out with a staffe, now stockes All Shechims country with his Herd and Fold: The land of Canaan scarce can all his substance hold."
21022,"The Heathen say, that heau'nly Prouidence To mortals here for labours Blessings sell: And therefore do require all diligence Of all, that would haue all things prosper well."
21023,"Of Abstinence and Continence some tell, That giue a man with little, much content; Which of anothers inch will make an ell, By whom nought lauishly on Lusts is spent, But onely needfull wants of Nature to content."
21024,"Fabricius thus with little, doth despise Great Princes presents, and the gifts of Kings: His Flocks him cloath, his Farmes with food suffie."
21025,"Scranus is his plough a-following, When as the Senate comes, him newes to bring, That they him their Dictator had elected."
21026,"Braue Curius, who, for Empires managing, Was after of all Consuls most respected, Dwelt in a country-Cottage all alone neglected."
21027,"More royal's sure Content in Pouerty, In little homely Bres, which can defend Vs from Sunnes heate, and Ayers iniury, Then glistring Towers, where they waste & spend In pompe and luxury, what God doth lend: There, costly Dainties oft with poyson wound: Here, without cost, the earth sound Cates doth send: There, golden Vessels, purple Beds are found: Here, all the flowry bankes do rest and quiet sound."
21028,"When Alexander, in a little Tunne, Saw a great Tenant with content of mind, The Cynicke, Lo, saith he, that here doth wu More rest, than I in all the world can find: I couet all, he nothing lesse doth mind."
21029,"They surely haue more pleasure, and lesse paine, Who are with little vnto Thrift inclin'd, Than they that seeke a world of wealth to gaine, That they may more indulge to ease and pleasure vaine."
21030,"One praiseth hunger, as best sawce to meat, Because it cost him least, yet sauour'd best, And alwaies with delight did drinke and eate, Because he ne're did without hunger feast."
21031,"Some onely liue to eate, drinke and digest, But we ought onely eate and drinke to liue; To liue to feed, is to be like a beast: Who would in reason more, than sense, be thriue, To body needfull things, to Soule must plenty giue."
21032,"Xantippe's said once Socrates too blame, For that he often made an inuitation Of greatest friends; yet's fare was still the same, Auoyding alwaies costly preparation: Soone he replide thus to her allegation: If, as they seeme, they be our friends indeed, They will respect our Thrift; but if for fashion They make a shew: let's to our selues take heed, And not spend our estate, them daintily to feed."
21033,"These patternes are of frugall abstinence, Which, as you see, the Heathen eu'n adore; Now see the holy fathers prouidence To raise themselues to plenty being poore: No, Abraham, Booz, and a thousand more, Liue vpon Tillage, Grazing, Husbandry, And tend their flockes, come, cattell, grasse, and store: Yea, Kings did hereunto themselues apply, To ioyne Magnificence with this Frugality."
21034,"Eu'n after Saul anoynted is a King, He followeth the Cattell from the field, And they that death to Ishbosheth did bring, Came to buy Corne; it seemes he Tillage held."
21035,"None e're did so magnificently weld A Scepter, as did royall Salomon, To which his Thrift such wondrous store did yeeld: To his sheepe-shearing sprucest Absolon, Inuites eu'n princely Dauid, and his eldest sonne."
21036,"See how great Princes, and the sonnes of Kings Are not ashamed of Frugality."
21037,"Priests liu'd indeed of Tythes and Offerings, And therefore lookt most to Gods husbandry: Paul had a trade, although a Pharisie; And though he to th' Apostleship attaine, Yet workes he in his Trade and Mysterie, His liuing with his labour here to gaine, Nor will he charge the Church, though bound, him to main∣taine."
21038,"Th' Apostles all were Fishermen, and gain'd Their liuing, by induring wet and cold: Diuines thinke, Ioseph blessed Iesus train'd In his owne Trade, till he thrise ten yeeres told."
21039,"I could be yet three times as manifold, This Vertue with examples to commend, But I had rather be a little bold, And you perswade her practice to intend; One's for her praise, but this is counsell for a friend."
21040,"Oh what a happinesse it is to liue, And do much good, without offence, to all!"
21041,"To eate secure those cates our ground doth giue, To lie so low, one can no lower fall."
21042,"Yet haue eu'n there Content imperiall: No wickednesse can enter such a Cell, Highest delights, that can a Prince befall, This priuate Cottage may affoord as well, Where care not halfe their sorrowes vnto thee will tell."
21043,"To many, Rit from meane to great estate, Is not an end, but change of Misery: The fault is in the Mind, (not in the Fate,) Which is the same in wealth and pouerty: Who onely mind change and variety, Liue ill, because they still begin to liue: They rightly here inioy prosperity, That so much pleasure to their Bodies giue, As they not for, but in the Body sought to liue."
21044,"Happy is he, who neuer saw that one With whom he would exchange his meane estate; Most miserable, who to that are come, They things, which were superfluous of late, Haue now made necessary to their state: Such are eu'n slaues, not masters of their pleasure; They loue their ills, which is the hardest fate."
21045,"there is no remedy nor measure Of Vices, when as men esteeme them as a treasure."
21046,"No good befals a man vnder the Sunne, The which his mind is not prepar'd to lose: No losse more easie is to any one, Than of the things he hath no need to vse: He's neuer poore, who Natures rules doth chuse; Nor rich, that liueth by Opinion: Natures desires be finite; boundlesse those, That false Opinion depend vpon, Loathing no Sallet: Hunger likes an Onion."
21047,"Sure he is best, to whom with sparing hand, God giues sufficient, let him wish no more: In need of things superfluous to stand, Is miserable want, in greatest store."
21048,"Excesse oppresseth many, who before With little could haue liu'd and beene content: These, though they haue enough, yet stil be poore, Because they first beyond their compasse went: This euill prudent Thrif betimes seeke to preuent."
21049,"Who is not made in Husbandry to sweat, May sweat in Arts or Lawes politicall; 'Tis fit all earne their bread, before they eate: Nothing is more expensiue, prodigall, Than to haue nothing here to doe at all: Want of employment, Ease, and Idlenesse, Haue caus'd more noble Houses here to fall, Than Fortunes blasts, or Enuies bitternesse."
21050,"Let him not liue to spend, that nothing doth professe."
21051,"Then let him neuer liue, that doth professe What's worse than nothing, basest Vsury: Herein is certaine profit, I confesse, But alwaies with anothers misery: Is this the vertue of Frugality?"
21052,By others losses to increase our store?
21053,"Then so is rapine, theft, and robbery, Selling of Iustice, which oft bring in more, Than all the frugall Trades I named haue before."
21054,"Since Nature with so little is content, Who here would vse vnlawfull Arts for gaine?"
21055,"We are but Stewards here of what is sent, If we our Talents vse aright to gaine, We twice as many shall of God obtaine: But if to hide them in the earth we chuse, Or spend them on our Lusts and Pleasures vaine, They shall be tane from vs, who them abuse, And giu'n to such as shall them to Gods glory vse."
21056,"But I so worldly Thrift haue followed, That I forgotten haue to thriue in Grace, And as it in the world is practised, Must put her off vnto the second place: For I so neere haue finished my race, I must deferre this to another time: God grant we may them both aright imbrace."
21057,"Now, like good husbands, knocke we off betime, And be at worke to morrow in the mornings prime."
21058,"how Birds for morrow take no care; Secure, God will due food for them prepare: Can woorthlesse Birds be confident of meate?"
21059,"And is a farthing-Sparrowes Faith so great, She knowes, but by Gods will, she cannot fall?"
21060,"And shall Gods sonnes, Christs images, once call In doubt their Makers will, to do then good?"
21061,"No sure: who lends them life, will giue them food."
21062,"THe frugall Husband, which I erst describ'd, So soone as Titan with his glistring Beames, Begilds the locks of stately Pines, which hide The tops of Mountaines from his hotter gleames; Walkes foorth amongst his cattell, flocks & teames, His Land to open to Sunnes mellowing heate, And feed his Herds along the siluer streames, To drinke and bathe, when they their fil haue eate, That fat they him may feed, that now prouides them meate."
21063,"Thus early rising; as the Prouerbe sayes, Brings Thrift in body, in estate, and mind; The early riser spends in health his dayes, And by his diligence doth plenty find; And in the morning better is inclin'd To Prayer, and diuinest Meditation: Thus, in a three-fold Cord, he Thrift doth wind; He driueth Slouth farre from his habitation, His Soule in Grace, his Body by recreation: For these respects the Husbands country life Transcends the Citie trades mechanicall, Or showes at Court, where reign Ambition strife, Or Merchants which on hazzard stand or fall: For though Thrift in estate these oft befall; And Thrift in Grace, in many there we finde, Yet scarce a strong sound Body 'mongst them all, They want pure aire whereby the bloud's refinde And wholesome exercise to contry life assign'd."
21064,"Well as I could, I rich Frugality Did late, as her beseemed well, array: I next describe foure of her company, Which alwayes with this thrifty vertue stay: The first two well I name the daughters may Of Prudence, Prouidence, and Diligence, Next two themselues from Temperance conuay, Thrifts Sisters, Abstinence and Continence: Of these foure I would sing, and first of Prouidence."
21065,"thou by whose most pow'rfull onely Word, All was of nothing made and finished, And of this All, mad'st man the little Lord, That by him All might well be ordered: Who hayers of our head hast numbred, Nor lettest the least Sparrow fall to ground, But as thou hast before determined, Make heauenly Wisedome in mine heart abound, That I may wade, not drowne, in Prouidence profound."
21066,"There is Diuine and humane Prouidence, Diuine is infinite, vnlimited Transcending Reason, more than Reason Sense, And may to glorious Sunne be likened: The Stars who thence their light haue borrowed, Doth humane Prouidence resemble right, Which by diuine is aye enlightened, And though like Starres it oft appeareth bright, Yet when the heau'nly shines, it is obscured quite."
21067,"Then pardon, Reader, if my Muses eye Dazeled with glory great, and splendour bright Of Prouidence diuine, heere to descry Vnable is the darke obscured light Of humane; as indeed I ought by right: When I come to her Sister Dlgence, I may recouer well againe my sight, My Muse now rapt with heau'nly Prouidence Can not descend to highest humane excellence."
21068,"But that I may describe her as a Grace, And linke her in the vertues golden Chaine, her th' Almighties Sceper call or Mace Which doth all Peace and Order heere maintaine: The bounteous hand, which al things doth sustaine, Whose eyes for nourishment vp to her looke, Who iust's rewards, and eke the wickeds Paine Doth register for euer in a booke: Thus, as Gods Truth and Loue, she fer a grace is tooke."
21069,"Thus one eternall powrefull Prouidence Heere gouernes all things being by Creation: The necessary Age, is, wanting sense, Receiue their motion by her ordination: The voluntary by her moderation Are aye dispos'd, and rul'd by their owne will, Which will she vseth as a Mediation; No man against his will doth good or ill, Though without Grace we of our selues no good can wil."
21070,"Sure Adm in pure innocence was free To eate the fruit forbidden, or abstaine: Else iustly how could he condemned be, Except he had a power to refraine?"
21071,"But since that gult originall did staine, With him, all imps which from that stock proceed; We still retaine freewill, none dares gainesaine, But it is onely vnto euill deed, Grace onely by New birth a will to good doth bred."
21072,"Schooles may dispute; the Truth is plainely this: As we are men, we power haue to will, As men corrupt, we alwayes will amisse, As borne againe, to good we haue a will."
21073,"Thus Nature Freewill giues, Sinne bends to ill; Grace vnto Good: But now I seeme to stray From Prouidence diuine, to mans freewill, But this as needfull shew I by the way, How Prouidence doth voluntary agents sway."
21074,"Her Nature yet more plaine to vnderstand, We must conceiue the worlds great Marischall, As he made all things by his mighty hand, So he for euer them disposeth all By Prouidence; not onely generall, By which the Spheres in their due motions ride, And Summer and the winter seasons fall, But as he by his speciall doth guide And orders euery thing, that doth on earth betide."
21075,"And this we call diuine Necessitie, Free from Coaction, which doth all dispose To proper ends, yet with free liberty Of Will, the things we doe to leaue or choose: Thus in respect of God, that future knowes As present, all effects are necessary, And, in respect of second causes those, To vs contingent are: Last voluntary, As they respect mans will, and motion arbitrary."
21076,"God wonders sees in Moses weeping face, When Pharao's Daughter him in Arke doth finde, As she by chance, did wash her in that place, And's mother for his nurse, by chance assign'd; And when to leaue the Court hee was inclin'd, His Brethrens uell bondages to see, He went forth with a free and willing mind; Lo thus in this example all the three, Diuine foresight, man's will, and Chance in one agree: And therefore when of Fortune you do reade, With reference to man it vnderstand, Who most to the euent of things take heed, Not to the Cause, Gods most Almighty hand: Else Chance and Prouidence can neuer stand Together in th' Almighties gouernment; Who being Cause of all he doth command, Them orders all vnto a sure euent, Though farre aboue mans limited intendemen."
21077,"Of things indeed which seeme by chance to be, The Order, Cause, Necessity and end Are hid, in Gods close Counsell and Decree: We onely able are to apprehend By the euent, how God doth them intend: Thus Clerk's a threefold working doe obserue Of Prouidence; which far their reach transcend, And yet they all to one same end doe serue, To shew Gods glory, and his creatures to preserue."
21078,"Thus meanes and second causes she doth vse, Oft workes without, by power immediate, And oft to worke against meanes she doth chuse: Two last men call Necessity or Fate, Because the Cause they can not calculate: (Oh richest Wisedome, Knowledge without bound Of the Almighty!"
21079,"without time, or Date, Thy Iudgements no man able is to ound, Beyond all mens conceit, thy counsels are profound.)"
21080,"Like this is that Philosophers assigne To Counsell, Nature, Chance and Prouidence; By Counsell, they meant Will and Reasons line; By Nature, force of heau'nly influence; By Chance, when they below beheld euents, But not their Cause: Last when some Grace did fall Past Natures, Chance, and Counsels euidence, That Speciall Prouidence diuine they call, Not but they vnderstood she had her and in all."
21081,"Sweet fruit of Prouidence to be perswaded, That all below is ordered by Gods hand, Nothing by Chance: Thus when we are inuaded By Foes, Death, Hell, we most vndanted stand: We, God prime cause of all things vnderstand, Respecting yet inferiour in their place, Which alwayes wait vpon the first's command, And all are to the glory of his grace, Whereby God his elect doth aye in loue embrace."
21082,Oh what inestimable quietnesse!
21083,"From hence ariseth to a godly minde, Though euils without number him oppresse, Which like so many Deaths he then doth finde, Knowing not how his wretched selfe to winde From Cruelty, which him fast followeth, And doth so fast with cords and fetters binde, That eu'ry minute threateneth his Death; And scarcely suffers him to draw his languid breath."
21084,"Yet if this Light of heau'nly Prouidence Shines to his Soule; then all Anxiety, Feare, Care, Distrust, are banisht quite frō thence, And he releeu'd in all extremity: Then knowes he that one gracious Maiesty, Heere by his power so directeth all, By wisedome rules, and by his Bonity Disposeth so, that nothing euer shall, But for Gods glory and his owne good him befall."
21085,"To fleshes obloquy, some giuing way, Confesse the highest Powers gouerne all, But that with mortals heere they vse to play, As we at hazzard tosse a Tennis-ball: Some all would haue by Chance and Fortune fall; Some others grant that God doth all incline, But that mans wit, and will must worke withall, These men with God in gouernment, doe ioyne And his most constant purpose to mans will confine."
21086,"Some, to excuse God, grant that Power diuine Permitteth euill, but not with his will, And suffreth Satan heere to blind the eyne Of Reprobates; but no wayes ill doth will, But sure God willingly permitteth ill, Since by his power he goodnesse able is, To draw from ill, his purpose to fulfill; For thus did Pharaoh wilfully amisse, Yet God turnes all to's glory, and his chosens blisse."
21087,"As Sunnes pure beames exhale from filthy Oose Foule vapours, which no whit the Sunne defile, So doth Gods Prouidence of ill dispose, Yet of no euill he partakes the while: And as not in Sunnes Beames, but in the soyle, The matter of th vapour doth consist, So in mans heart is Bitternesse and bile, And not in God, who euill doth resist, Or turnes such euill into Goodnesse, as he list."
21088,"Thus Kings, Priests, Rulers, Elders all combin'd Against the Lord, and his anointed Sonne: And Pilat, Herod, Iewes and Gentiles ioynd, To doe what God decreed to be done: But they ment wickedly eu'n euery one, The people a vaine thing imagined, To crucifie the Lord of Life they runne, But God, we see, thereby hath quickened The members all, whereof he is the glorious head."
21089,"As when we see faire Phoebus gentle beames, Vnited in a burning glasse, enflame, We vse not to accuse Sunnes gracious gleames, For such offence, but Burning-glasse doe blame, Wherin, without the Sunne, 's nor heat nor flame."
21090,"So when we see the wicked man abuse The fairest gifts of Nature to his shame; The Author of them we must not accuse, But wilfull man, that doth them heere vnduly vse."
21091,"Good, Powerfull, Wise, Disposer of all things!"
21092,"So wse thou all Disorders ordrest right, So good thy Goodns good from euill brings, So pow'rfull all subsist vpon thy might: How should an ignorant, weake, wicked wight, Conceiue thy Wisedome, Power, and Prouidence?"
21093,"Much lesse by Simile it more inlight, It farre surpasseth mine intelligence: Things knowne I doe admire, the rest I reuerence."
21094,"But I by Prouidence diuine am led To passe the bounds of fugall meditation: Pardon, great Clarkes, that I haue meddled To taste a mysterie, by Contemplation, Worthy your argument, and disputation: I was desirous to resolue my minde In this high point of heau'nly moderation, Wherein most wondrous comfort I doe find, To see how things on earth are first in heau'n design'd."
21095,"Who can suppose this world so perfect, rare, Not gouern'd by one pow'rfull prouidence?"
21096,"Since all which without moderaturs are, Consisting of the foure first elements, Can not continue; Houses, enements, Without a tenant, ruine and decay: Vnpruned Vines doe loose their excellence, Mans Body failes, when soule doth passe away; So would this Vniuerse, should God forbeare a day."
21097,"As members of a man aright do moue First by his vnderstanding and his will, So doth this Vniuerse by God aboue, And all concord his pleasure to fulfill: Who duely wait on Prouidence, he will Make happy heere, and blessed euermore: Not that he doth the carelesse idle fill With blessings temporall, or heau'nly store."
21098,"Who will not row on Sea, shall neuer come a-shore."
21099,"It is a dangerous and impious thing, Thus to dispute with Prouidence diuine, Mine arme nor good, nor bad, to passe can bring, All's done by the Almighties firme designe: The written Word must be our square and line, Gods secret purpose, and reuealed Will Confound not by a vaine conceit of thine: Thus Theeues may, blamelesse, true men rob and kill, And say they but Gods secret purposes fulfill."
21100,"For Prouidence doth not vs mortals tend, As mothers infants newly brought to light, Which haue no strength themselues then to defend 'Gainst ayers iniuries, or forreine might: But as the Father that his Sonne hath dight With strength, and weapons 'gainst his enemies, Directeth him to order them aright, And to defend himselfe from iniuries, Religion neuer negligent and idle lyes."
21101,"They that are godly and religious, With Prouidence sweet Diligence do ioyne, God that without our selues hath fashion'd vs, Without thy selfe saues neither thee nor thine: And therefore prudent men prouide in time, Against all future want that happen may; When therefore we for morrow do designe Things necessary; none can iustly say, Or iudge vs too much carefull, for the following day."
21102,"The Lord of all did needfull things prouide, Therefore the bagge false Iudas carried, The Loaues and Fishes which he did diuide Amongst fiue thousand which him followed, Th' Apostles carri'd for their dayly bread: Paul temp'rall Almes prouideth for his Nation, Where he the spirituall had published: Ioseph from Nle comes to make preparation, To saue aliue old Iacob and his generation."
21103,"Of these learne to prouide things necessary: Of Beasts to shunne and to auoid all ill; Who neere things hurtfull to them do not tarry, Nor nigh vnto those places trauell will, Where they into a Ditch haue lately fill; The Bird escapt, eschewes the Fowlers gin, Nor will be tempted more with all his skill: The fish that finds the hooke the bait within, Thence to prouide against such danger doth begin."
21104,"Things past, for future, are sound documents, He that is wise, the euill doth foresee, And hides himselfe from many nocuments, Which can not by the foole auoided be: Most admirable, vertuous, wise is he, That things foreseeing wisely can prouide, Nothing on earth without a cause we see, Though them the highest Wisdome so doth hide They can not by our feeble reason be descride."
21105,"The World may be compared to a Stage, We mortals to spectators, they that stay Without to see her antique equipage; Doe truely as they ought behold the play: The curious that about the Stage do stray, And pry into the secret tyring roome, Are by Stage-keepers often driu'n away: All must not into Natures secrets come, Although she many Mysteries reueale to some."
21106,"How dares proud man inquire so curiously Of Gods id counsels, and his secret will?"
21107,"The Bethshemites into the Arke did pry, And God with sudden vengeance them doth kill."
21108,"Prouide thee good things, and auoid the ill, So maist thou many liue, and happy dayes, Presume not to be wise aboue thy skill, By Gods reuealed will guide all thy wayes, His secret Counsels search not, but admire and praise."
21109,"And yet because God all doth here dispose, Thou like a senslesse Idol must not stand: God gaue thee not for nought, eares, eyes, hands, nose, A will to do, a wit to vnderstand: Employ these alwayes by his iust command, The whole successe leaue to his Prouidence, Acknowledge all good blessings from his hand, And labour, with all care and diligence, To thriue in Goodnesse, Grace, and all Intelligenc▪ But aboue all from murmuring refraine, Or magnifying flshes arme or might: So axe may boast, that it along hath laine The Cedars; and the Plane may claime, as right, That by it's worke thy roofe so faire was dight: So may the rod of Moses bragge and boast, It all the Wonders did in Pharaos sight: The Asses Iaw-bone, that it slue an host: But most the house, when Samson pulled downe the post."
21110,"On whom we ought to cast eu'n all our care, To him we must ascribe the Praise of all: In his hand both our Soules and Bodies are, By Power of his Breath we stand and fall: From him all was, is now, and euer shall: Of all the things done vnderneath the Sunne, TheEecl."
21111,"17 Wiseman sought a reason naturall, But was as blind, as when he first begunne, Though first he thought he could discouer any one."
21112,"Gods counsels shall for euermore indure, His thoughts stand firme in eu'ry generation; Our hearts he fashions, and conceiueth sure, Our workes▪ and secretest imagination: Who to the Rau'ns giues food and sustentation, So gouernes all, they nothing here shall need, That wait on him with patient expectation: With temporall and heau'nly he doth feed All those, that craue aright of him spirituall eed."
21113,"In number, measure, weight, he doth dispose Of all things; He preserues both man and beast: When care and paines may saue thee from thy foes, Vse diligence, to God commit the rest: And when thou art so mightily distrest, Thou canst no helpe in arme of fles behold, Vpon his prouidence that made thee, rest: That  And in his Booke hath eu'ry one of them inrold."
21114,"Good counsell gaue that Heathen, Haue a care Vnto thy selfe; most of thyselfe take heed: He meant, Lusts and Corruptions which are Within vs; which to vs most danger breed: With others we deale warily indeed, Lest they deceiue vs by their subtilty, But our owne vile affections little heed, Although we haue no greater enemy; Thus we escape Gaths sword, and on our owne do di."
21115,"The Iewes may with their Oratour conspire Pauls ruine; nothing shall to him befall, But to aduance his Crowne, and Gospell hier: So as his bonds in Caesars Iudgement hall, Are manifest and famous 'mongst them all: To the Elect, and those that truly loue, Nothing but for the best shall euer fall: This by examples thousand I could proue, Happy who finds it written in his heart by loue."
21116,"The Lyons want and hunger may endure; Who sekes the Lord, wants nothing that is good, The Angel of the Lord him keepes secure, From his owne lusts hels fury, wickeds mood."
21117,This of the weakest may be vnderstood.
21118,"If ought here passeth thine intelligence, Sucke thou the milke, and leaue the stronger food."
21119,"Here ends my song of heau'nly Prouidence, Next, followes her attendant humane Diligence."
21120,"WHo, with a prudent heart, and godly minde, Wil take a view how things are wrought below, In all effects shall good and euill find, As cause is good or ill, from whence they flow; Thus God first Cause of all thy actions know, As they be good; thy selfe as they be ill; Which doth Gods pow'r and goodnesse greater show, In vsing heere mans vile corrupted will, As second cause his sound, good purpose to fulfill."
21121,"All euill then comes from mans vicious will, Not moou'd thereto by meere necessity, As senselesse Agents are to good or ill, But giues consent thereto most willingly: By Natures Light we good from ill descry, But this vs onely leaues without excuse, When seeing better we the worst doe try, And thus God of mans malice makes good vse, And he is iustly punished for his abuse."
21122,Oh mans peruersenesse!
21123,"grant him least freewill, And he becomes vaine, proud and insolent: Dny him any power to doe or will, And he growes lazy, slothfull, negligent: First kinde are meritorious, impudent, And merit for themselues and others will, The other Epicure-like, take content In pleasure, eating, drinking of their fill, Or in an idle, melanlique sitting still."
21124,"But Diligence, the Grace I next propound, For this last euill is best remedy, This Viper which most dang'rously doth wound Our soules with senselesse spirituall Lethargy, And brings too aspish-lazy Accidy: Most perilous, because we feele least harme."
21125,"Oh, this is Satans subtillest Lullaby, Our soules with stupid lazinesse to charme, And then of spirituall armes and weapons to disarme▪ Thou that hast promis'd endlesse happinesse, To all which at thy comming thou dost-find Intent vnto their Masters businesse, And diligent in body and in minde, Make all my Soules and Bodies powr's inclind To Diligence, whilst I her praises write, Vnloose the chaines, the fetters strong vnbind Of Sloth and Dulnesse, which, to blackest night Leade blindfold, drowsie soules that take therein delight."
21126,"Vigilance, Industry, and Diligence So like indeed one to another are, My plainer Muse scarse sees a difference, And therefore all will but as one declare; Our soules and bodies powers they prepare, In eu'ry noble Vertue to transcend, Nothing on earth that's admirable rare, Without these can be brought to perfect end, On these do honest care and labour aye attend."
21127,"For godly, iust and necessary cares Are parts substantiall of Diligence, And as she for the future thus prepares, Hauing to Truth and Iustice reference, She is a Grace of wondrous excellence: But if she spring from Enuy, emulation, Ambition, Feare, or other base pretence, She is a curious base abomination, The busie vice that author is of desolation."
21128,"Industry best agreeth to the mind, In which she frames a quicke Dexterity, In Arts and Sciences the right to find, And they that know her wondrous energy, In Phisicke, Law, and in Diuinity, Know, that she tends the neerest to perfection, And is to humane imbecillity Most sound defence, secure, and safe protection, 'Gainst Satans Malice, their owne Lusts, & worlds ifectio."
21129,"We well Dame Nature may the Mother name Of noble Industry and Diligence, Yet oft we see their wondrous force doth tame, Things against Nature, without violence; All other Vertues glorious excellence, Which we in Heroes iustly do admire, Haue their Beginning and Perfection thence: Where Industry and Diligence conspire, Wants nothing that we can in mortall man desire."
21130,"For as she many euill things amends, So is she of all good the consummation, Most dissolute base manners she commends Soone, vnto honest thrifty reformation."
21131,"An infirme body by exercitation, And Diligence, becommeth strong and sound: She frees old-Age from grieuous molestation Of painefull sharpe Diseases that abound."
21132,Fields of the diligent are fruitfull eur found.
21133,"For by this Diligence all well succeed, No idle hower on her head doth shine, She her best howers spends with prudent heed, And all her businesse aright doth line, She finds to all things an appointed time, Except it be for Slouth and Idlenesse."
21134,"If idle words be iudged such a crime, Much more the losse of times high preciousnesse, Which cannot be regain'd with cost and carefulnesse."
21135,"Wherefore good fathers of a Family, First rise, and latest go to bed at night: And those that loue the Muss company, Do vse their eyes to read by Candle-light."

21137,"Nothing so difficult, but by the might Of Diligence, is conquer'd in the end, Therefore in all affaires she is our surest friend."
21138,"But non more enemies than Negligence, Slouth, Dulnesse, Carelesnesse, and Idlenesse, Impurest mire of foule Concupiscence, The forge of Lust, and draught of filthinesse; Whence come all Vices, Sinne and Wickednes, Which turne men into Beasts, like Sirens charmes."

21140,"Vnnecessary Burthen on the ground, Who when he hath consumed all his owne, Deuoures his friends, and then a theefe is found, More false, yea, than a begger bolder growne; For though the beggers-bodies hands are sown, And's mind is all on slouth and idlenesse, Yet often in his mouth Gods Name is knowne: But God all honesty and shamefastnesse, He loaths that is possest of slouth and sluggishnesse."
21141,"A Sluggard is vnto himselfe, and all A most pernicious wicked enemy, By Slouth his mind and body soone do fall To sicknesses, and all impurity: He is the bane to all good company, The stinking Sepulchre of one aliue, Shadowes of men!"

21143,"We Sloth, like Lazy Asse, at home do finde: But listen out, you lowd shall heare him bray, Iust like a coward dogge of currish kinde, That doth at harmelesse Pilgrims barke and bay; But comes a Wolfe, for feare he runnes away: Like fearefull Hart, when as he comes to fight, But as a Lyon greedy of the prey; All day asleepe, but in the dead of night, He woorrieth the fould, for hunger and despight."
21144,"perfection of all, When as thou dost with truth and vertue dwell, But if to Vice and errour thou doe fall, Thou passest Hggs and Furies all of Hell; Hels waking Cerberus is not so fell, As popish priests, who compasse Sea and Land, Into Cymmerian darknesse to compell Those that in Sun-shine of the Gospel stand: Thus diligently they obey their Lords command."

21151,"will all our wealth surmount, And our Omissions more than numbers vp can count."
21152,"This Diligence is like one in a Myne, That digges much earth a little gold to find; Like Silkeworme, who her slendrest silken twine, By Diligence doth on a bottome wind: Like husbandman, who little sheaues doth bind, Wherewith he fils his Barnes and Garners full: Like little stones by Morter fast combin'd, Raisd to a Temple large and beautifull: Like mighty hostes which Dukes of single men do cull."
21153,"Some by a night-Owle, and a Dragons eyes, This vertue Diligence haue figured, And therefore Poets Fables do deuise, The Golden-fleece so highly valued, Kept by a Dragons diligence and heed."
21154,"The Golden-fleece, the Kingdomes Peace I call: The Dragon, him by whom all's ordered: For on whose shoulders such a charge doth fall, He must be vigilant, and diligent in all."
21155,"This Vertue is indeed most soueraigne, In highest Rulers which the Publique sway, Who are set ouer vs for our owne gaine, If them as Gods Vicegerents we obay: They keepe continuall watch both night & day For all our goods, so they be diligent: God grant such Rulers euer gouerne may His little Fold within this Iland pent, To ioy of all our friends, and foes astonishment."
21156,"The Latines, Diligence deriue from Loue: For he that loueth, doth eu'n all fulfill, Yea nothing hard or difficult doth proue To him, that knowes 'tis his beloueds will; Whose hearts this glorious Grace of Loue doth fil, They here despise all losses, griefe, and paine: Let heau'nly loue into mine heart distill, I worlds discouragements will all disdaine: For Diligence on earth, I loue in heau'n shall gaine."
21157,"This loue in Dauids heart doth so aboun, It from his eyes and eye-lids did expell All sleepe, till he a resting place had found, Wherein the Lord of life might alwaies dwell."

21178,"though Lord of all, who yet art borne To labour, as the Sparkes do vpward flie, To learne here of thy Vassals do not scorne, But eate thy Bread in sweat continually."
21179,"In Labour did the Fathers liue and die, To do Gods will was Christ his drinke and food, Not to dispute thereof with subtilty, And nice distinctions, which do little good, But make things easie erst, now hardlier vnderstood."
21180,"One thing is necessary, doe and liue: Practice and Knowledge, must goe hand in hand: The gods for labours, blessings here do giue, Not curious knowledge: They that vnderstand, And yet forbeare to doe their Lords command, Thereby most inexcusable become, When all before the dreaded Iudge shall stand, More then shall heare the finall dreadfull doome, For things omitted here, than things which they haue done."
21181,"Like Plutarchs Lamiae, we are quicke of sight Abroad, at home we lay aside our eyes: If each his owne affaires could order right, That town would soone to wealth and honour rise: The street, where ech his dore sweeps, cleanly lies."
21182,"I do not here forbid all forraine care: To paire of Compasses I like the wise, Halfe of their thoughts at their hearts center are, The other, round about, do for the publique care."
21183,"The Cynicke, that he might his hate expresse To Slouth, would often tumble vp and downe His Tunne, to keepe himselfe from Idlenesse."
21184,"Base Commodus, of all the Caesars knowne To be most wicked, was not of his owne Nature so vile: but when his youth by ease, Into contempt of Businesse was growne, This was the Empires fatall last disease, Which lost the Caesars all their fathers did increase."
21185,Oh cursed Negligence!
21186,"that dost confound Soules, Bodies, Churches, Cities, Families; No gracious Thrift will grow vpon thy ground, Thy field like wildernesse all barren lies."
21187,"It Soules, like deadly Opium, stupifies: It with diseases doth our Bodies fill, Puls downe our Temples, which did dare the skies, Layes ope the City walls to Victors will, And thorow houses roofes rain-droppings makes distill."
21188,"Bewaile with me the ruthfull Tragedy, That Slouth hath made within this holy Land, I meane, thoseAbbeys, &c. Houses faire of Sanctity, Which like so many Pyrami'ds did stand, Erected first by holy Founders hand: First raisd by Diligence, now raz'd to ground By Slouth, those lazie-belly-gods to brand With shame, whose Idlenesse did thus confound Those Places, where Gods holy Worship should abound."
21189,"Behold, with Salomon, the sluggards field, Which all ore-growne with Mosse and Bushes lies, Whilst Rents and Sales to him abundance yeeld, He lookes not after Industries supplies, Like Grasse-hopper, he skipping liues, and dies, Or sterues, if Winter bringeth Pouerty: Th' industrious Ant, and Bee he doth despise."
21190,"the sinke of all iniquitie, That changest men to swinish Bestiality."
21191,"Awake you sluggards, you that powre in wine, The day's at hand, when you account shall make; As of your workes, so of your idle time: To some employment do your selues betake, And sayle not alwaies on the idle Lake: It is a filthy, muddy, standing poole, No good, or honest mind can pleasure take, To row at ease in such a muddy hole, Though there his vessel's subiect to no winds controule."
21192,"Oh you, whom God, eu'n gods on earth, doth style, Withdraw not from the weight of gouernement Your shoulders, nor let Ease your soules beguile Of time, which should be in deuotion spent: Rulers must most of all be diligent, All euill cleaues on them by Idlenes."
21193,"Looke on all States, and forraine Regiment, They all corrupt by Ease and slouthfulnes, But flourish, and grow strong by frequen Busines."
21194,"You heau'nly-Watchmen, of whom I desire Rather to learne, than teach you ought to mend, Marke onely what Paul doth of you require, With diligence your selues and flockes attend; God made you ouerseers for that end: As nought more than assiduous Exercise Of Soule and Body, doth from sinnes defen, So nothing fills them with iniquities, More than this sluggish slouth, and idle vanities."
21195,"Elian doth of th' Egyptian Dogge report, That when he drinkes, he neuer standeth still By Riuers side, lest poysonous beasts him hurt, Who li in waite, him whilst he drinks, to kill: Oh could we see the poysoning serpent still, Waiting occasion with invenom'd sting, Our bones with Lust, and Luxury to fill▪ And vs by slouth, and idlenesse to bring To carelesnesse of God, and any holy thing."
21196,"That thus would wind vs from all Diligence, Like lazie Sluggards, onely to rely Vpon th' Almighties care an Prouidence; But lo, the Israelites send first to spie The earthly Canaan, which did typifie That heau'nly; whither, through this Wildernesse, We must not hope to passe so easily; They wanne the cities which they do possesse, With paines and Diligence, not slouth and idlenesse."
21197,"This was their way, this also must be ours; Priests feet the flouds of Iordane may diuide, Their trumpets throw downe Iericho's proud towres: But Ai will many bloudy blowes abide."
21198,"He little thinkes Hels force, that neuer tride."
21199,"Th' Amalekites, and Moa will assay To stop thy course to Iordans fruitfull side: Thou must with Diligence maintaine thy way, And fight with hardy resolution night and day."
21200,"Lord grant I may, like Paul, be diligent, Who wrought his owne, and all the Soules to saue, That with him in the ship to Caesar went: And though he knew, that God, who to him gaue Eu'n all their liues, his promise would not wau▪ Yet see, he leaues not any meanes vntride."
21201,"Lord grant me Diligence aright to craue, And Patience thy leasure to abide, So nothing that I aske, shall be to me denide."
21202,"My Muse would faine aboord, but Diligence Would neuer let my Meditation end, And blames me sore, that I with Negligence, Too briefe the story of her Praise haue pen'd; But Care and Labour next I must attend; Which two, with Diligence, go hand in hand: God, better lucke, me in their praises send!"
21203,"I now will driue my little Boat to land, And rest, that I more stoutly may to labour stand."
21204,Of Care and Labour.
21205,"MY freer Muse now like a Faulcon flies, Who hauing stoup't a Mallard at the Brooke, Remounts againe vp to the azure skies, And for a second Souse at him doth looke: But suddenly she hath that prey forsooke, And towreth at a Heron in the Ayre: So though at first my Muse had vndertooke Faire Absinence; yet seeing Thrift doth pray her, To sing of Care and Labour next, I will obay her."
21206,"This Booke indeed I wholly did intend Vnto the honour of Fruglity, And morall vertues that her Grace attend: But so my Muse doth loue her libertie, And at the fairest is so vsde to flie; She will not leaue her heau'nly Meditation, For any Flower of Humanity: Her food diuine of holy Contemplation, For any earthly Good, Content, or Delectation."
21207,"I grant indeed, that morall Meditation May much amend our manners, and our mind, But no such pleasing taste and sustentation, As in diuine, the soule of man can find: And therefore though I often am inclin'd, The Praise of morall Vertues here to sing, My freer Muse that will not be confin'd, Runs straight on string, Else I, in others not meddeling."
21208,"And yet I hope no wiser Clerkes will blame My boldnesse, here to taste, by meditation, The Mysteries, whose knowledge they proclaime To vs, as necessary for Saluation: Thereby to square our Liues and Conuersation."
21209,"And though indeed my Writings I intend, For others minds and manners reformation, Yet if hereby I may mine owne amend, I haue attained more then halfe my wished end."
21210,"It is no part of holy Contemplation, To seeke reuenge for vndeserued wrong; Meeknesse and Patiences meditation Haue taught my Muse to sing another song: God send me more Wit, them a better Tong."
21211,"Now Thou, that Adam in his vprightnesse, (To shew, that Labour doth to man belong) Didst place in Eden, it to plant and dresse, Helpe me, the praise of Care and Labour to expresse."
21212,"Care's an attent intention of the mind, To any thing that's needfull to be done, Which good and honest for our selues we find, And may vnto the publike profit come: Labour puts Care in execution, And is our minds and bodies Enargy, In any businesse by Care begun: For when to Businesse we do apply Our selues, we call that Labour, Paines, and Industry."
21213,"Care comes from Wits chiefe Vigor, Strength, and Light, And ready, watchfull euermore doth stand: Labour, the Bodies Faculty is hight, Which doth performe the thing we haue in hand: Where these two powr's of action do band, We Actors and Directors call them may; One doth what worke the other doth command: For as the Body doth the Soule obay, So Labour is to noble Care obedient ay."
21214,"Lbour and Care, simply considered, Nor good, nor ill are, but indifferent, And not amongst those Vertues numbered, Which in the Court of Loue are eminent: But for they nothing, that is excellent, Can without Care and Labours helpe attaine, All in their Company take great content, And honour much amongst Loues royall traine: And glad is she, that can their best acquaintance gaine."
21215,"Care's like an old experienc't Generall, Too weake to fight, yet orders all the Hoste: Labour is lusty, valiant, young, and tall, And strikes, where foes he may indanger most: Care hath an eye about to euery Coast, With all aduantages to win the day: And though more sweat and blood it Labour cost, Yet which deserueth best, 'tis hard to say; Neither had wonne the field, had one but beene away."
21216,"When Iupiter an Hercules would frame, Three nights at once he with Almena lay: Thus to beget one that should Monsters tame, Men lost, to lengthen out the night, a day: Besides, the pangs of Birth her so dismay, It little fail'd, but she had borne her last."
21217,"By witty Fictions, Poets thus bewray, How it Ioues ordinary strength surpast, A true Ida of high Labour here to cast."
21218,"And thus they make Ioue, Hercules his Sire, Who must on earth all Labours vndertake; And clense worlds Stables from impurest mire, And Ioue of him a mighty god should make."
21219,"To tell what for immortall Honors sake He did, were too long for a Meditation: He made the yron-gates of Hell to quake, And Atlas-like, bare vp the worlds foundation, What can be more for Care and Labours commendation?"
21220,"He was not fostred in his younger yeeres, With Pleasures, wanton Ease, and Idlenesse, But fought with Lyons, Tygres, Goats, and Beares, Lust, Rapine, Tyranny, Vnrighteousnesse."
21221,No high thing is attain'd by Slouthfulnesse.
21222,"Then spake great Alexander like a King, By calling seruile Slouth and Lazinesse, But Care and Labour highly honouring, Which in small time to him worlds Monarchy did bring."
21223,"No good thing without Care and Labor growes, With them is Thrift, without a barren Soile: Labour increaseth strength, and who her knowes, Doth passe through hardest iourneys without toile."
21224,"Labour our fiercenese naturall may spoile, But raiseth Vertue: Labour doth restore Those that are fall'n: things hardest reconcile, She Vertue by employment furthers more."
21225,In all achieuements Captaine Labour goes before.
21226,"And Pleasure followes: for obserue these two, Delight and Labour though much differing In nature, yet they link't together go; Delight, I say, still Labour following: For things we labour most to passe to bring, We ioy in more, then those which vs befall By Chance, and without Paines and labouring."
21227,"That conquest is mo glorious of all, Which hath indanger'd most the Hste and Generall."
21228,"No solace without Labour: no man gaines The Hony, without danger of the Sting: He that will haue the Kernell, must take paines To breake the shell: who, sweetest Rose in Spring Will gather, feares not Bushes prickeling: But he that in his bosome hides his hand, Whom honor, profit, feare, nor shame can bring To action, but doth all day idle stand, He hates all Vertue, and is hated by their Band."
21229,"The Roots of Arts are bitter, but they beare The sweetest fruits: we can no Good obtaine But by hard Labour."
21230,"Thus if we prepare Vs quiet Peace, what happinesse we gaine?"
21231,"The Minds and Bodies rest, them fits againe For Cares and Labours new: as Bow vnbent, Or Lute-string loosed to a lower straine, That it may be vp to a higher pent, And that the Bow may shoot the stronger newly bent."
21232,"God here hath placed on our either hand, Commodities and Discommodities: These neere, those far, Labor 'twixt both doth stand: To these a way prone and precipite lies, Who comes to those, great difficulties tries, Which they by Labour onely ouercome."
21233,"Labour which wise mens wishes here supplies, And doth to them the trustiest Guide become, Eu'n from their infancie, vnto their resting Tombe."
21234,"Worse than the vilest Infidell is he, That will not care nor labour for his owne: How many goods and benefits there be, To men on earth by Care and Labour knowne; So many ills by Carelesnesse are sowne: Base Carelesnesse and Slouth!"
21235,"But I before In Diligence their Pedigree haue showne: I sing the vertue of the vice no more, She to my Muse yeelds matter most abundant store."
21236,"For Care and Labour is the very orne Of Amalthea, and all plenteous store: She brings good-husbands store of grasse and corne, And plentifully feeds the hungry poore: She makes the Shepherds lambes grow great and more, She is the stay of Trades and Merchandize; As good on surging seas, as on the shore: All needfull things she by her hand supplies: Labour most actiue is, Care politique and wise."
21237,"Like Abshai and Ioab when they fought With Ammon, and the Syrians on the plaine, Both constant, noble, resolute, and stout, Both striuing, that they may the day obtaine: If that the Syrians ground on Moab gaine, Then Abishai must helpe: if th' Ammonite Preuaile against Abshai: Ioab againe Must succour him, with all his force and might."
21238,"Care, Labour thus, from losse, each mutually acquite."
21239,"Lbour betweene the Graces and the Mind, Is as the light 'twixt colours and the fight: As without light the Eye is alwaies blind, So without Labour dwels the mind in night."
21240,"And as the Lord ordained hath the Light, To be the meane here colours to discerne, So Labour, he appoints the medium right, Whereby the mind may Grace and Vertue learne, And ioyne them fast together by a force intere."
21241,"And as all lfe and actiue strength proceed From feeding, so from Labour all our good: And as Men, to prolong their life, do feed, So good-men haue for good to Labour stood."
21242,"As necessary to our life is food, So vnto honesty is exercise; And as none will expect fruit from the wood, Except he blossoms first thereon espies, So there's no hope of Age, that paines in Youth despise."
21243,"As is a womans fruit without a man, So fairest hopes are without Labour vaine: Many haue hotly at the first began, But Courage want to th'end it to maintaine: Like some rash Summers storme, or dash of raine, That corne beats downe with sudden inundation, But soakes not halfe so deepe in flowrie plaine, As showres that fall with sober moderation: Things violent incline to sudden alteration."
21244,"And as we nothing to our healths do find More dangerous, than Ayers alteration, So nought more hurts the Body and the Mind, Than change to sluggshnesse from recreation."
21245,"Delight or Labour, without moderation, Destroy mens bodies, and their wits onfound, Like Nightingales, that take such delectation, Sweet notes aboue their fellowes to propound, Their spirits faile, and they are dead with singing found."
21246,"Many will labour, but they soare too hie, Or else most basely snke downe to the deepe; They either will into Gods secrets pry, Or downe into Earths baser bowels creepe: A few or none true moderation keepe; They either diue for profits base and vaine, Or clime vp to Gods secret Mountaine steepe: In both their steps no longer do remaine, Then way of Bird in th'ayre, or ships vpon the Maine, You that the Muses Secretaries are, And pen the counsels of the King of Kings, I know your Labour, Industry, and Care, To vnderstand and publish holy things: Which vnto you such Ioy and Pleasure brings, As we that feele it onely vnderstand."
21247,"Yet mount you high, Sol fries your waxen Wings; If low, them Neptne wets with wauing hand: The golden Meane 'twixt two Extremes doth alwayes stand."
21248,Fraile mortall man!
21249,"if thou with fleshly Eye Behold'st the Sunne, thy sight is dazeled, Much more with brightnesse of Diuinity, Is thy Minds weaker Eye astonished: Glory shall him amaze, that will aread The Splendour of eternall Maiestie: Mans Mind, here with corruption limited, Hath no such ample large capacitie: No mortall seeth me (saith God) but he must die."
21250,"Some Meates the appetite do more prouoke To eating, we of them must take most heed; Such are the Labours which are vndertooke For too high Knowledge, or wrlds baser meed: For these prouoke our appetites indeed Vnto Extrmes, from that faire golden Meane; Which do our Callings here so farre exceed, To which corrupted minds so much do leane, They alwaies fall into a curious Exeme."
21251,Base wretched Cares!
21252,"whose Labour is in sinne, Which bring vs terrours in true pleasures steed, Vncessantly here taking paines to win Base Mammon, and this worlds vnrighteous meed▪ Or an ambitiou humour base to feed, Or their meane House to highest pitch to rayse, Or for Reuenge, or lustfull wicked Deed, Or to gaine popular applause or prayse, And be a precedent vnto succeeding dayes."
21253,"As greater Fowles, though they be strong of wing, With bodies burthen are so weighed downe, They cannot mount like nimble Larke in Spring: So minds of men to these worlds Cares fast sowne, Soone like this world, are grosse and heauy growne: And though they might, by noble Industry, Be raisd againe to vnderstand their owne; Yet stupid, senslesse on the dunghill lie, Drunke with foule Ease, and this worlds base Commodity."
21254,"These louers of the world, though they wax strong In things terene, in heau'nly weaker grow; For worldly honour they will sweat and throng, Bu to win Crownes in heau'n are dull and slow: For worldly Gaine they ought will vndergo, From heau'nly, least reproach or shame will bend: For Princes fauours they whole dayes will woo, But not one howre to God in Prayer spend: Thus present Shewes, not future Glory, all intend."
21255,"What Labour hard, what time can we thinke long, Which doth to vs eternall glory gaine?"
21256,"To haue our wils no labour seemes too strong: For Vertue, wee'l not least delight refraine."
21257,"Thinke but what holy Labour may obtaine, A certaine hope, and sweet remuneration, Of which, the Saints, forsaking Pleasures vaine, Haue by their liues giu'n plenteous commendatiō, Here labouring all, whilst they liu'd, in their Vocation."
21258,"Here Plenty makes me sparing: read the acts Of all the holy Fathers till the Flood, From thence, to Egypts Bondage: next, the facts Of Moses, Iosuah, Kings and Iudges good: Haue they not all for Labour stoutly stood?"
21259,"This shunning Labour by a Hermits Cell, A late deuice is of Romes lazie brood, To mumble Prayers, and their Beades to tell, But take no Care for neighbour, Church, or Commonweale."
21260,"Is this Pauls Watching, Paine, and Wearinesse, Thirst, Hunger, Scourgings, Nakednes, and Cold; Perils by land, by water sore Distresse?"
21261,"Besides, his outward labours manifold, His inward Cares the Church in Peace to hold?"
21262,"A liuing man lye buried in a tombe; Lest worldly and labours him withhold From contemplation of that heau'nly roome, Where neuer such a slouthfull, idle wretch shall come."
21263,Braue actiue spirits!
21264,"though in Contemplation I spend much time, yet I your liues do hold To be more worthy praise and admiration, You bring to vs all good, and ill withhold: You, whose great cares and labours do vphold, Like Atlas shoulders, ciuill Gouernment: Your Splendors we, your cares cannot behold, Who know the Care and Weight of Regiment, Would neuer enuy them, their glory and content."
21265,O Muses Darlings!
21266,"do not then abuse Your heau'nly Numbers, (which the Muses lend To honour of Authority to vse) Their names with blots and infamy to blend."
21267,"Your Muse not able is to apprehend Their deepe Foresight, that States and Kingdomes sway: With care and labour they at Helme attend, That sleepe and sing in ship you safely may: No gentle Dogge will at his Keeper barke and bay."
21268,Great Keeper of this famous Brittish Ile!
21269,How dost thou care and labour for our ease?
21270,"Besides Kings ordinary Paynes and Toyle In Gouernement, thy Writings do increase To largest Volumes, for the Churches Peace: For Christs pure Spouse, and thy deare Kingdomes weale: Thy Watchings, Prayers, Labours, neuer cease, Else blos'mes of Vines, the Fxes soone would steale, Or wild Bore root vp all thy Church and Commonweale."
21271,"When in his large, wise, vnderstanding heart, We, for our Good, such cares continuall see, What secret Malice can a man peruert, To deeme that in his Loue, and Wisedome he Aduance will any to Authoritie; But whom he eu'ry way doth able finde, To care and labour for the safety Of Church and Kingdome, to his care assign'd?"
21272,Wise Masters best discerne how Seruants are inclin'd.
21273,"Great Peeres appointed, by this Master wise, To Rule his Kingdome, and adorne his Hall, Of him learne Labour and braue exercise, And doe not vnto idle gaming fall: The Bane of Court, Towne, Country, Church and all: Oh spend the time you from emploiment spare, In  And so with Piety your minds prepare, To labour in your charge, and haue of heau'n a care."
21274,"Besides examples of your earthly King, Looke on our Lord that sits in heau'n aboue: Who heere on earth was alwayes labouring, Now as our Head himselfe he doth approue, Most carefull for his Spouse and dearst Loue."
21275,"See his Disciples, Saints and Martyrs all, How carefull and laborious they proue, In  Relieuing poore in want, redeeming Saints from thrall, Amongst these Lights of Labour, with me looke On one, though little, yet of wondrous might, Who, Dauid-like, takes stones out of the Brooke, The proud Goliah in the front to smite: Oh how do'st thou most valiantly acquite!"
21276,"God and his Church, against Rome's railing Host, And that Augean stable purgest quite, Though it thee mickle care and labour cost: Of this would Her'les more, than all his labours boast."
21277,"Could Sloth her selfe that sweet Delight but taste, Which comes of Paines and honest exercise, Her precious time & strength she would not waste, In Idlenesse and worldly vanities."
21278,"But like to nimble arke wold early rise, Who mounting first to heau'n Deuotions sings, And afterwards her businesse applyes, So long as Light lends vse of eyes or wings, And then in est enioyes fruit of her trauelling."
21279,Most sweet Delight!
21280,"at night when wearied, We end the Cares and Troubles of the day, When priuate, publique hauing profited, We down our selues with Peace and Comfort lay: Not like rich Mizers, to their Soules, that say, In this abundance lye thee downe and rest, When ah!"
21281,"Who knowes but eu'n that night away, His Soule forth from his Body may be prest, And he all vnawares o're taken in his nest?"
21282,"Vnnecessary Labours, worldly Cares, Which on themselues, not Prouidenc depend, My Muse to them no such great fauour beares, As heere amongst the Graces to commend."
21283,"All things created serue vnto their end, For which God at the first did them ordaine, And all vnto his Glory doe intend: Why then should man be slothfull, idle, vaine, So long as heere on earth he doth in health remaine?"
21284,"He hath a minde firme, valid, rais'd on high, Able to soare aboue the Firmament, And by sweet Contemplation to descry The heau'ns swift motion, Order, Gouernment: All things are subiect to his Regiment, In squallid Slouth and ease yet downe he lyes, Till thou who first didst frame his earthly tent, Dost raise his mind to heau'nly exercise, Which may by Care and Labour him immortalize."
21285,"Not axious, vnprofitable cares, Base off-spring of Distrust and Diffidence: With present, alwayes, discontent; and feares Vaine, future wants, or childrens Indigence, Distrusting thus Gods gracious Prouidence, Which fils with open hands the mouthes of all, Whose eyes looke vp to his Beneficence, And Lillies clads in colours naturall, More faire than Salomons rich robes imperiall."
21286,"He that this all did first of nought ordaine, And now it gouernes by wise Prouidence, Is by his Bounty able to sustaine, All those that labour with true Diligence: Sure he will giue aboundant recompence To all, who carefull, faithfully doe heere Rely on him, without least Diffidence: He for his Foes did spend his bloud most deare, Why then should Friends distrust his Prouidence and Care Kindle thy Loue then in my frozen brest, Frame in my minde a study and desire, To follow thee, that canst direct me best, By thy command to march on or retire."
21287,"Awake me from Slouth's filthy durt and mire, Lest darknesse me fast-sleeping apprehend, From which to Light againe i no retire, Let me no houre vnprofitably spend, Nor passe one day vnfruitfully vnto mine end!"
21288,That faithfull seruants blessing on him light!
21289,"Whom Thou so doing, when thou com'st shalt find, Grant, whatsoeuer hower of the night My Lord and Master comes, my soule and mind May to continuall watching be inclin'd: But lest I labour heere too long in vaine, I next will passe vnto my Port assign'd, To Death; the end of all my Care and Paine, To graue, where, till the finall doome, I must remaine."
21290,"There quiet I shall sleepe and be at rest, With Kings, which heere their houses fill'd with gold, And Emperours, which all the world possest, Yet all too streight ambitious thoughts to hold: There small and great, free, bond, rich, poore, young, old, Oppressors, prisoners haue like fruition Of rest: All turne againe to dust and mould, As small an Vr then limits the Ambition Of Popes, and Caesars, as of Beggers meane condition."
21291,"COme, let's shake hands, we in the end must meete: I haue prouided me this goodly Chain Of Graces, at thy comming thee to greete, For thou wilt not for fauour, gold or gaine, Thy fatall stroke, one moment, heere refraine: Well, close mine eyes, and dimme my Bodies Light, These shining Gems for euer shall remaine, My soule for to enlighten; Oh!"
21292,"then smite, It skils not when, nor how, so as my heart stands right."
21293,"why look'st thou so pale, as thou didst feare?"
21294,"Thee, before men and Angels, I forgiue, I wish thee not a minute to forbeare, I neuer shall the Life of Glory liue, Till thou vnlock'st the doore my soule to giue Inlargement from this Prison-house of clay, For which she long hath struggled and did striue, Yet still the Flesh, the Spirit downe doth way; And fitting 'tis I should my Makers leasure stay."
21295,"Thou earthquake-like this prison house must shake, Before my Soule be loosed from her ands, And make my Kpers tremble all and quake, Lo then a holy Angell ready stands, To saue her from hes-watches grizly hands: And though heau'ns sudden Light my Soule amate, She forward goes, and nothing her withstands, A ioyfull entrane to most happy state, Thus passe we thorow Deaths-doore, in at heau'ns narrow gate."
21296,"Welcome, as sleepe, to them that right thee know, And easie as a Downy-Bed of Rest, But thou most gastly-terrible dost show, To those, that thou do'st vnawares arrest: Sweet hau'n to Soules with worlds winds, waues opprest; A Rocke to those that swimme in sweet Delight; Sweet hoast of Saints, who with perfumes hath drest The Beds, wherein their Bodies, all the night, May rest, till Trumpets sound, awake to glorious Light."
21297,"To Poore thou shew'st thy honey, hid'st thy sting, The Rich thy Sting, but no thy honey see, Like Iailour thou doest good and bad newes bring To Soules, that in the flesh imprison'd be; One must dye euer; th'other shall be free."
21298,"Thou that dost Death, to thine, by dying make The Messenger of such great ioy and glee, Direct my Muse, in what I vndertake, That I may Death discerne, ere Death we ouertake."
21299,"What's Death but a diuorce or separation, Of Man and Wife, that neuer could agree, From Bed and Bood, and from Cohabitation?"
21300,"The guilty Flesh payes Costs, the Soule is free; Yet Both ere long shall one another see, Freed from foule Sinne, the cause of all their strife, And shall in Wedlocks Bands reioined be, To loue, and liue, for aye, like Man and Wife, A holy, happy, quiet, and eternall Life."
21301,But this I of the first Death vnderstand; (Lord!
21302,"of the second, neuer let me taste) This is the way into the holy Land, That doth into continuall darknesse cast: No mortall Sense did euer see or tast The seconds anguish, terrour, horrour, paine: The first is short, the second aye doth last, Age, Sicknesse, men to dye the first constraine, The Diuels in the second, soules and bodies chaine."
21303,"This, setteth willing soules from bodies free, That, soules in bodies holds against their will, By this, from Bodies weight we quited be, That, with such weight of sinne the soule doth fill, As to the Pit infernall presse it will: This, takes good men away before their time, Lest they be ouer-whelm'd with too much ill, That, seizeth on the wicked, for their crime."
21304,"That leadeth downe to Hell, by this to heau'n we clime▪ The first, hath onely power in the graue, Second, in Hell; One, vs depriues of sense, By th' other, sense of endlesse Paine we haue, Both, haue one name, yet see their difference."
21305,"Sinne mother is of both: In innocence Had Adam stood, Death neuer had been knowne, But second Adam hath remou'd long sence The sting of this first Death, eu'n by his owne: Thus from a Plague, Death is to Saints a fauour growne."
21306,"Christ meeteth her as Esau on the way, And giues a charge vnto her rougher hands, No euill against Iacob to assay; Thus turnes he to embracements all her Bands; Death, made by Sinne our mortall foe, now stands Our first fast friend, to bring vs vnto blesse; And though awhile our carkases she brands With vile corruption, ad Rttennesse, Our soules the whilst abde in ioy and happinesse."
21307,"All first Death gets, is Rottennesse and Dust, A Body onely, in corruption sowne, To kill seeds of Concupiscence and Lust, That it more glorious after may be knowne, Our earthly part thus turneth to her owne, But shall againe a heau'nly body rise, And as at first, be with the Spirit one, Which long hath liu'd in ioyous Paradise, Waiting till Christ her mortall should immortalize."
21308,"why should wee then be so afraid, Heere to endure a little griefe or paine, Be it on Racke, or Bed?"
21309,"so I be laid Safe in my Graue, my soule thereby shall gaine; Lord!"
21310,"grant me Faith, and Patience to maintaine Hels last encounter, when my Soule is shaken!"
21311,"The holy Martyrs did not so complaine Of Paine, when Soule was from the body taken, As when their Conscience by tentation was awaken."
21312,"This Death, though painefull, quicke dispatch doth make, The second, hath eternitie and paine, They rightly at Death's horrour, quake and shake, Where griefes within, more than without remaine, Whose conscienc them more terribly doe straine, Than any outward torment they endure, Who sees heau'ns most incomparable gaine, And can thereof by Faith himselfe secure, Is certaine, Death can nought but good to him procure."
21313,"For body fraile, one like his glorious head For pleasures, profits, hopes and honours vaine, (Whereby than eas'd, we are more troubled:) Eternall rest, and freedome from all paine, Wer't thou, my Soule, but sentenc'd to remaine In this fraile body, yet a thousand yeeres, Oh!"
21314,"how wouldst thou of wearinesse complaine, And maladies thy Flesh about her beares, And seeke Death as a blessing eu'n with many teares?"
21315,"Yea should this life last without tediousnesse, Oh!"
21316,"Doe but thinke that as thou more do'st sinne, Thou addest more vnto thy wretchednesse, For Death at first, by Sinne did enter in, Who would not leaue these loathsome ragges!"
21317,"to winne That glorious, shining roabe of Righteousnesse, Thou shalt not lose thy Body, but thy Sinne, Thou it againe shalt meete in happinesse, Corruption shall indeede be changed, not thy Flesh."
21318,"As Golden Ore, in Finers fier cast, Is not consum'd, but cleans'd from drosse, and tride; So substance of the body doth not waste, Onely by Death is purg'd, and purifide."
21319,"Should Soules heere in their Tabernacles 'bide, With all infirmities till Day of Doome, How weary would they be, of rest denide, And wish their Bodies sleeping in their Tombe, Vntill the ioyfull Day of Resurrection come?"
21320,"So long as heere our Bodies doe remaine, They haue like Wooll one ticture naturall, But Death them dyeth all in purple graine, To make them Robes for Sprites Celestiall, For we in heau'n like Kings and Princes all Shall reigne in new Hierusalem for ay, The Graue vs like each side of Red Sea wall, From cruell Egypts bondage on our way, Doth to the Land of heauenly Canaan conuay."
21321,"As he, who for ill-doing lyeth bound, Trembles & quakes when loosed from his bands, He must before the Iudgement Seal be found, To giue account for workes done by his hands, But he most stout and resolutely stands, Whose Conscience him of euill doth acquite: So men reioyce, or feare, when Death commands Them to appeare before the Iudge vpright, There to receiue iust doome, for things done wrong or right."
21322,"As water-drops, which fall in Fountaine pure, Die not, but are preseru'd incontinent, So Bodies perish not, but ay indure, Onely resolu'd to their first Element: Our spirits fly to heau'n whence they were lent."
21323,"As drops of raine which from the heau'ns descend, Are all into the wombe of Tethys sent: So Saints dead Bodies to Earths bowels tend, Whence drawn vp by Sonnes heate, to heau'n they re-ascend."
21324,What is our Life?
21325,"a wind, a course to death: They that on Earth the longest course can gaine, Runne in the end themselues quite out of breath, And no more but their courses end obtaine; To which, they that liue fewer yeeres attaine."
21326,"God here to men doth life, like money, lend: Which at our Day we must pay backe againe."
21327,"As without oyle the Lampe no light doth send, So when our humid's spent, our Life is at an end."
21328,"As Pilgrim with long trauell wearied, Layes downe his Flesh to sleepe in darkest night, But Visions houering about his head, Do shew vnto his Soule most heau'nly Light, And doth with Dreames his spirits so delight, He wisheth oft the night would euer last: So fares it with the new-deceased wight, When in the graue his Body sleepeth fast, And Angels haue his Soule in Abraams-bosome plac't."
21329,"As Starres of heau'n, which first in East do shine, Arise, till their Meridian they haue past, But do from thence as fast againe decline, Till they into the Westerne Seas are cast: Eu'n so vaine Mortals, here are all in hast, Till they their highest pitch of strength attaine; But that once got, they fall againe as fast, And downeward to the graue descend amaine, Some here a shorter, some a longer course obtaine."
21330,"And as hee's happiest, whom the swiftest wind Brings soonest to the Port, and hau'n of rest, So's he, that soonest in the graue doth find Harbour against worlds stormes, which him infest."
21331,"Death doth but like his brother Sleepe arrest The weary wight, where he a longer night, Himselfe in graue, than in his bed may rest; And yet no longer, than till Christ our Light Awakes vs, to enioy for ay his glorious sight."
21332,"To all that labour, pleasing is the end; The Traueller inquireth for his Inne: The hired Seruant, when his Yeere doth end: The Husband, when his Haruest doth beginne: Merchant of his Aduentures comming in: The Woman, when her ninth Month doth expire: So Saints, of Death haue euer mindfull bin: For where's our Treasure, there's our hearts desire, And where our Crowne is laid, our eyes do ay aspire."
21333,"Therefore the dying Saints like Swans do sing, Foreseeing, that they in the graue should rest From Labours, and be freed from the sting Of Sinne, which here their liues did most infest: Why should we with Deaths feare be so distrest?"
21334,"When as the Lord of Life himselfe did die, That we from sting of Death might be releast; Eu'n Sinne, the Cause of all our Misery, And made Death our first step to true Felicity."
21335,"The truth hereof the sacred Pages seale, When that which commonly we dying call, They call it sleeping: For Christ did repeale The Act of dying, by his Funerall: Thus  Lie sleeping, till the finall Resurrection, From Adm, to the Iudgement generall, All to this faall Lord must yeeld subiection, And sleepe scure and sound vnder his safe protection."
21336,"The Wiseman therefore, better doth commend The Day of Death, then of Natiuity; By that, our paine and labours haue an end; This, the Beginning is of Misery: The Lord of Life, who Life and Death did try, Proclaimeth endlesse Blessednesse to those, With rest from labour, in the Lord that die: Blessed whom he to liue in him hath chose, But till their  See, but how wiser Heathens entertaine This fatall stroke, this last necesity: How they on Birth-dayes, lowd lament and plaine; At Funerals, make mirth and melody; For that begins, this ends all misery: No man, say they, that doth not Death despise, Can here on earth enioy true Liberty, They onely saw an end of miseries, But lo!"
21337,heau'n stands wide open vnto Christians eyes.
21338,"Ah why should Painters limme Death with a dart, Time with a Syth, before him cuts all downe, Death doth but lance, and play the Surgeons part, Time fells the Corne, that's ready to be mowne."
21339,what Cruelty hath Death vs showne?
21340,"Thou art but as a Seruant vnto time▪ To gather Fruits which, he saith, ripe be growne: In Wine-presse thou but treadet out the wine, To barrell vp in Tombs that there it may refine."
21341,"As we greene Fruites more difficultly pull, Than those we find hang ripe vpon the tree, So youthfull Sprites of heate and vigor full, More hardly die than they that aged be: This is the greatest difference we see, Betweene their courses that are short and long, Both goe the broad way of Mortality, Death, like a mighty wind here layes along, As weake and hollow Elnes, so Cedars stout and strong."
21342,Who is so strong whom she hath not cast downe?
21343,"Looke all the generations gone and past, Their ancient Monuments by Bookes are knowne, In Grae their Bodies all to dust do waste; The Iewes long-life more eagerly imbrac't, As 'twas a type of endlesse happinesse, But since Christ in his youth of Death did taste."
21344,"All Substances fulfill'd, their Figures cease, Now happiest he whom Death the soonest doth release."
21345,"Happy, though clouds of stones thy head infold Like Steph'ns, so open heau'ns shew pure & cleare, And though a Trance like Pauls so fast thee hold, That whether thou without the Body were, Or in the Body, thou canst not declare."
21346,"Though thus Death doth like sleepe they flesh arrest, The ioyes of heau'n shall to thy Soule appeare, Not to be vttered: Lo, they are best By Negatiues, not by Affirmatiues exprest."
21347,"No eye hath seene, no eare hath euer heard, No heart conceiue, no tongue that can recite The ioyes, th' Almighty hath in heau'n prepar'd, For them that here do liue and die aright: Oh enter Soule into thy Lords delight!"
21348,"This ioy thou canst not in thy selfe containe, For thou art bounded, that is infinite; Who enters, shall for euer there remaine, And for these finite Cares, Ioy infinite obtaine."
21349,"who can know this Death, and be afraid?"
21350,"Although amongst the pots thou lie a time, Thou like a siluer Doue, shalt be arraid With golden feathers, which like heau'n shall shine."
21351,"Thus with my selfe I do diuine, Without least perill, by free Speculation: But should Death seize on this my brittle Shrine, And offer me to act my Meditation, How should I tremble at my houses desolation!"
21352,"That which is now familiar to my thought, Will bring me then Amazement, Horror, Feare."
21353,"this battel's not so easily fought, Except Iehouah on our side appeare."
21354,"Didst thinke, Death would with Complement forbeare, And onely thee delight with Meditation?"
21355,"No, he will try what courage thou dost beare, And seize vpon thy Fleshes habitation, It laying waste, till all in Christ haue restauration."
21356,"Then as I feele this outward man decay, Grant I may strong and stronger grow within, And by a constant daily dying may Be arm'd, against this strong man enter in; That though he seize vpon this man of sinne, My inward man may like the siluer Doue, That newly hath escap't the Fowlers ginne, Fly to her Lord and Sauiour aboue, And be embraced in his blessed armes of Loue."
21357,"there I shall inioy eternall rest, And happy Peace, which here I craue and misse, And wander further more and more distrest."
21358,"What if some little paine in passage is, Which makes fraile flesh to feare Deaths pallid kisse?"
21359,"That paine's well borne, that endlesse ease doth gaine, And from Sinnes cruell slauery dismisse."
21360,"Sleepe after Toyle, faire-weather after raine, Peace after Warre; ease is most pleasing after paine."
21361,"We all are wanderers weary of our way, And hasting to the Graue our certaine home: This world's the Flood which doth our passage stay, TillDeath Charons boat to weft vs ouer, come."
21362,"Who Life did limit by eternall Doome, And times for all things hath established, Appoints each Centinel vnto his roome, And so the termes of Life hath limited▪ None may depart, but by their Captaine licensed."
21363,Nefarious wretch!
21364,"who with flagitious hand▪ Dares violate the Temple God did raise, A Mirrour here of all his Workes to stand, His wisedome to commend, and goodnesse praise: He that appoints the great worlds nights & daies▪ From her Creation to last Reuoltion, Determins all thy small worlds workes and wayes, Who wilfully then hasts his dissolution, Seekes to gain-say his Makers constant resolution."
21365,"The longer life I know the greater sinne; The greater sinne, the greater punishment, Yet if thou Souldier-like art entred in, Thou must go on with stoutest hardiment, And not depart without commandement."
21366,"Oh lie not downe, and thee to rest betake, Ensuing ills of liung to preuent▪ Though life hath nought that can her loued make, Yet giues it no iust Cause that thou should'st it fosake: And yet, O sinfull man!"
21367,"do not desire, To draw thy dayes forth to the last degree, Vntill the measure of thy sinfull hire, Be heaped vp with all impiety, Against the day of Wrath and Ielousie, Whilst thou this sinfull Body bearst about, Laden with Sinnes, and foule Iniquity, Their numbers more and more increase no doubt, Most happy he whom Death the soonest helpeth out."
21368,"Despaire not yet, fraile, silly, fleshly wight, Nor let Distrust amate thy manfull heart, Nor Satans malicing dismay thy sprite, Thou in thy Sauiours meris hast a part, Oh why shouldst thou despaire, that certain art Of Christ thy Sauiour?"
21369,"in him is grace, From thee for euer to remoue Hels smart."
21370,"And that accurst hand-writing to deface, No sinnes can be so great, but Mercy may haue place."
21371,"How then should any wretched wight be wonne, To spoile the Castle of his life and state?"
21372,Is't not Gods doing whatsoeuer's done In heau'n and earth?
21373,Did he not all create To liue and die by his eternall Fate?
21374,Who dares then striue with strong Necessity?
21375,"That constant holds the world in changing state, All ought be willing here to liue or die: Life, Death, ordained are by heau'nly Destiny."
21376,"Then witnesse Death, that willing I lay downe My Body, sure to put it on againe; My fleshly Baggage, for a heau'nly Crowne, My earthly Bondage in the heau'ns to raigne."
21377,"I leaue this Tent of brittle clay, to gaine In heau'n a mansion holy, spirituall."
21378,"Lo, my corruption here I downe haue laine, For incorruption, pure, Angelicall, And for a heau'nly Parlour, chang'd my earthly Hall."
21379,"Lord, this I craue, Direct me in the way, So shall I certainly attaine my end: If well my Part on mortall Stage I play, Saints, Angels, my beholders, shall commend My Action: God and Christ shall be my friend: And when my flesh to Natures Tyring-oome, From whence it came, shall quietly descend: It there shall rest vntill the Day of doome, And then in heaunly Quire a Singing-man become."
21380,"Sweet Death, then friendly let me thee embrace: He truly liues, that liuing, learnes to die: Now smiling, like a friend, I see thy face, Not terrible, like to an enemy: But I with Prayer end my melody: Lord grant, when Death my passng-bell doth ring, My Soule may heare the heau'nly Harmony Of Saits and Angels, which most ioyfull sing Sweet Halleluahs to their Sauiour, God and ▪ FINIS."
21381,"TO thee, poore Bird, in Cage imprisoned; How like am I, by Age visited?"
21382,"I cannot vse my horse, nor thou thy wing, And therefore both sit still within, and sing."
21383,"My Muse hath with my Body Sympathie: If well, I learne to liue; if sick, to die."
21384,"THis world a banquet is, we, conviues all, Where most, by Drinke, to sinne and surfet fall."
21385,"Who dyeth young, is like him that doth rise From banquet, ere the wine his wit surprize."

21399,"Astrea, of immortall Seede, Abhominates such foule and wicked deede: Wherefore they to the people her disgrace, And set vp wrong and bribing in her place."
21400,"The people, alwaies prone to imitate Their vice, not vertues, that do sway the state, Ioine with the Iudges al to beat down right, And take in guifts and doing-wrong delight."
21401,"Till Ioue, awaked with the piteous cry Of those that grone vnder Iniquity, The gods his Peares to Parlament doth call, And to Ol pus court them summons all: Wre they decree a Daniel to send, To iudge the wost, that al the rest may mēd: Thence doth Astrea lare, like Susan shine, And iudges measure by her equall Line."
21402,THE FIRST BOOKE OF SVSANNA.
21403,"Gods goodnesse in Iudahs captiuitie; Ioachims worth: what Elders ought to be; A good wife by Susanna is descride, The greatest Blisse that can a man betide."
21404,"The Elders each to other doe discouer Their Lusts, and plot their wishes to recouer."
21405,"I Sing the honour of that noble Dame, Who for true vertues sake despised shame; And rather chose to die with infamy, Then violate her sacred Chastitie: For she him made her confidence and stay, That made her righteousnesse as cleare as day."
21406,"Lucrece be mute; if chaste, why should thou die?"
21407,"If not, why should we praise thy chastitie?"
21408,"I sing of Iudges base, not more vniust In iudgement, than obscene in filthy lust; I sing of Iustice, Iudgement, Equitie, And knowledge of discerning Veritie."
21409,"Oh blessed Spirit, who didst the spirit dispose Of youth, the Elders malice to disclose, Direct my Muse; Iniustice to discour, That hating vice, I may be vertues louer: And teach me sing Susannas sacred story, To all chaste eares delight, and to thy glory."
21410,"Whilst Canaans Land lay seauenty yeeres vntilde, 2 Chr."
21411,"36.21 And Sabbaths all prophan'd had nigh fulfilld: The Abramites that vnder bondage groane, Sate weeping by the streames of Babylon: Their Harpes vpon the willow trees then hung, On which they lately Sions songs had sung; And though their voices had forgot to sing, And fingers touch of sweetest warbling string; Iehouah could not, for his Abrams sake, Forget the promise he to him did make: But gaue them fauour in the heathens sight, And dwellings both for profite and delight: And, lest they should these benefits despise, They had, within themselues, te exercise Of their owne Lawes; and Elders euery yeare, The people chose the gouernment to beare, Who might by vprightnesse, and skill in law, Protect the Good, and keepe the bad in awe."
21412,"Amongst the est, that in that region Had large possessions; In Babylon Ioachim had a house most rich and faire, Most pleasant, fruitfull, healthfull eke for ayre: But was renowm'd and famous, most of all, For one faire, large and open goodly Hall, Whither all Iewish suitours wont resort, For Iustice; there the Elders kept their Court."
21413,"Elders whih ought, by Iethros counsell wise, Exo."
21414,"Be men of courage, hating couetise; Fearing the Lord; in dealing iust, vpright; And able to discerne the wrong from right: But these were Ancients in iniquity, Malice, Iniustice and Adultery."
21415,"Both like in Ignorance, and base condition: Both rais'd by bribing, fauour and ambition: Not vsing Law hard causes to decide, For they all matters by one ballance tride; Whose guift weighs heauiest, victory obtaines, This mickle profit brings with little paines: Deferring strifes finall determination, Not thereby to take better information, But for to groape whose purse did heauiest way, And vnto him they alwayes giue the day."
21416,"These iudged then the congregation Of captiue Iewes that were in Babylon: And for Ioachim was a noble man, To him the people with the Elders came; Where they till noone the causes ouer call, As now our Iudges in Westminster hall."
21417,"This noble man was not so honorable For ancestry, or ought that's heritable, As for his vertues, Iustice, Pietie, Humblenesse, Meekenesse and Integritie."
21418,"These did his minde and actions more adorne, Than wealth, ambition, fauour, armes with scorne: These made him of the highest reputation, And sought vnto of all the Iewish nation; Who though he Patron was and Aduocate, And wondrous knowledge had, to rule the State, By his great skill in Lawes iudiciall, The Morall and the Ceremoniall; Yet seeing the corruptions of the Time, And Folly into Seate of Iustice clime: And that the most vniust and ignorant, By bribing, friends, or boldnesse, got the Grant Of highest Offices; Hee free from charge, Of publique Office, chose to liue at large: But for because, man borne he vnderstood, Not for himselfe, but for his countreys good, He tooke more paines, than any Magistrate, For wronged friends, and good of publike state."
21419,"So that his was the House of Iustice hight, His mouth an Oracle of Law and Right; The widows, poores, and orphans sure defendour, Th' Innocents aid, and terrour of th' offendour."
21420,"He ware a Lawyers Gowne to keepe him warme, But sould no Breath, to doe a poore man harme."
21421,"He that describe all heauenly Graces can, May tell the vertues of this noble man; Which he not only learnd, by contemplation, But acted to the good of all his nation."
21422,A good wife described.
21423,"&c.But aboue wealth and all this man possest, He with a faithful, honest wife was blest, In whom her husbands heart might safely trust, In wealth or want contented, true and iust, Who did him good, not euill all her daies, Industrious with her mind and hands alwaies: Like merchants ship that foode from far doth bring, Early and late her houshould ordering: Her working hand still open for to feede, The hungry, and to giue to them that neede: And in the Sommer for the Winter tide, She cloathing for her houshould doth prouide."
21424,"This made her husband so much set by, and To sit amongst the Rulers of the Land: Her mouth was shut, and couered her face, In one sate modesty, in th' other grace, In one did angelique sweet beautie shine, From th' other wisdome flowes, and grace diuine."
21425,"To many daughters, Graces rare befall, But chaste Susannna went beyond them all."
21426,"Amongst the fruits of her Industriousnesse, Who neuer eate her Bread in idlenesse, Shee plants an orchard fruitfull, rich and faire, Whither she with her Lord doth oft repaire, Themselues awhile from worldly cares to free, And on their handy workes Gods blessing see: There might they please, smell, touch, eate, taste and sight, With flowers, fruits, and musiques sweete delight; For through the same a pure streame murmured, To which the Birds sweete trebles warbeled, The winds amongst the trees a Base did sound, And flowers all enamelled the ground."
21427,"But lo the winds, birds, streames and all were mute, At nimble touch of Susans trembling Lute, Brooke staid, Birds ceast, and Aire calme became, To heare the heau'nly musique of this Dame; But most it doth her husbands heart reioyce, To heare her Lute outwarbled by her voice: Which seem'd a quire of Angels, which did praise The King of heau'n in Dauids holy laies."
21428,"So haue I often heard, in forrest faire, When Spring begins with calme and gentle aire, Groaues citizens, which thither doe resort, Oft sing by turnes, oft oyne in one consort; Till Philomele to welcome Phoebes light, Hauing their musique heard with due delight: Sends from her brest such lute-like warbeling, The other Birds are all asham'd to sing; And listening, in one straine most sweete and cleare."
21429,Doe all their changes in one Dittic heare.
21430,"And so haue I often seene the shepheard swaines, Wooing the shepheardesses on the plaines, Challenge their mates by single pipe and voice, And ioyne in consort with harmonious noise: That all the shepheards dance to heare them sing, And forrests all with ioy aloud doe ring, Till Phillis with one stroake of warbing Lute, The shepheards pipes, and voices all makes mute; Yea Collin Clout doth breake his pipe for shame, To heare the heauenly ditties of his Dame."
21431,"Thus oft she solaced for recreation, But most alone, for holy meditation, She in her orchyard walketh euery day, To reade the Scriptures meditate and pray, Where by sublime pure heauenly contemplation, With God and Angels she hath conuesation, And by true Faith, and her spirituall eye, As present doth the day of Christ descry."
21432,"This Di'mond of invaluable prize, Was soone discern'd by Elders lustfull eyes, Lust tht fierce Fire, which first in eyes conceiues, And raging enters in, and neuer leaues, Till all the body it hath set on fire, And eard the soule with wicked strange desire; Lke lightning, sent from Heau'n for cursed sinne, Which first on tops of Towers doth begin, Then fires the roofe, thence falls downe to the hall, And is not quench't til it consumeth all."
21433,"Sweet kindly heate, when youth kept in loues bounds A wife not womankind for scope propounds; But eu'n a sparke of hell, when it doth rage Amongst the Ancient, politique and Sage."
21434,"""Gy heads incontinent when they were young, ""As they grow weake in limbs, in lust grow strong."
21435,"This fire so fierce doth in the Elders burne, It all their mirth to heauinesse doth turne, Their cast downe eyes dare not behold the sight Of Heau'n▪ nor thinke on God that iudgeth right."
21436,"Deepe was indeede Selfe-guilty conscience wound, But they more violent Lusts fury found; Each his owne fire but not his fellowes knew, Not durst one it vnto another shew; Asham'd their filthy lust to her to tell, Yet both, to quench their flames, would burne in hel; Both wickedly doe proect day and night, That at the least they may enioy her sight: To haue their will on her both were full faine, But saw no meanes their longings to obtaine."
21437,"As Satan, when he would vs worke despite, Transformes him to an Angell of the Light, Lest if we should behold his proper Shape, Forearmd, forewarnd, we might his malice scape: So these two Carles in Susans presence sate, As if they all on Iustice meditate, And when they chanc'd with Ioachim to dine, Their table-talke was of all things diuine: Of a sound conscience, and equity, Wiues Loyalty, and virgins chastity; Thus hoping, by their queint Hypocrisie, To make a way to foule Adultery."
21438,"One day from Iudgement seate when both did rise, And either turned home as was their guise, Both streight returned, and together mette, With hope the sight of her alone to gett: Where either of the other doth enquire, The cause of their so suddaine backe retire."
21439,"Brother, said then, the Senior in degree, What is the cause I thee so heauy see?"
21440,"Doth any Ahab hold from thee some ground, That doth vpon thy house, or vieyard bound?"
21441,"Which thou desir'st for profite or delight, Tell me, and he shall know a iudges might."
21442,Or doth there any Mardochee deny To doe obeisance to thy Seignury?
21443,"Hast thou receiued wrong of any wight, And wouldst againe with sweete reuenge requite?"
21444,"Or tell mee, some faire Dame doest thou not loue?"
21445,"Whose Chastity thou art afraid to prooue: What euer be thy griefe, now tell it me, And vse my power, as I haue vsed thee."
21446,What doe we both like Kings o're Iudah raigne?
21447,And shall ought crosse our pleasure or our gaine?
21448,"No no, wee'le breake or make them all obay; We rule not if our subiects vs gainesay: My Lord, replide the puny Iudge againe, Tis not Reuenge, Ambition, Pleasure, Gaine, That so afflict my body and my mind, Tis Loue of Faire: but shame there stopt his wind, The word Susanna raine he would haue said, But was of man, though not of God afraid."
21449,"As two old theeues, that haue companions bin Oft times in Murther, Theft and fowler Sinne; Huing a Booty in one place espide, But neither others mind thereto descride, At diuers windowes slipping in by night, Into one Hall, which doth both much affight, (One for the owner first the other taking, And each a true man, for a Theefe mistaking,) Till by some secret markes each doth espy His fellow-theefe, there met vnwillingly, Wherewith both glad, hope easelier to obtaine, Their purpose, and be Sharers in the gaine: E'n so these Elders; who by might and fraud, Had often ioind in iudgement to defraud The fatherlesse, and widowes of their right, And to oppresse the weaker by their might; First feard one by the other to be spide, But after they had both their lusts descride, Ioy in their hap, and easelier hope to get, And share the Booty, for which there they met."
21450,"Thrice noble Mate, the elder Iudge replide, I see one fire in both our hearts doth bide, Which smothered, smoaking inwardly will bune, But blowne and stird, to purest flames will turne: I, by thy meeting here, doe surely ghesse, It is one Dame doth both our hearts possesse: For I haue oft beheld thee sixe thine eye, Vpon her beauty as she passed by, And therewith heard thee nly sigh and groane, As thou didst wish to be with her alone."
21451,"But, since sweete Cupid smites both with one Dart, Let vs not herein one another thwart, If discord our desires shall divide, Our powre and empire can not long abide: Let name of Rivall which breedes mortall hate, In youth, in age, our loues conglutinate."
21452,"Her beauty that than Sunne doth clearer shine, Hath heate ynough to warme mine heart and thine, And both our longings fully satisfie, Let's share in loues, as in commodity."
21453,"As strongest castle which doth fortifie It selfe t'endure the Siege of enemy, By force vnited's ooner ouercome, Than if they should assault it one by one: So shall we finde the Fortresse of this Dame, By both, than one, more easy to be tne: Yea if through waiwardnesse it shall stand out, By force or policy wee'le bring't about, Either with peace our pleasures to enioy, Or ruine it and vtterly destroy."
21454,"Deare Brother, I mine heart must tell thee plaine, My stomacke can not brooke, so fowle a Swaine As Ioachim, whom the base Multitude Honour as King, should thus vnto be sude Of all, to be their Patrone, Aduocate, And sway our powre in ruling o the State: Alleadging Law and Custome to maintaine Things, that so crosse our pleasure and our gaine; That he, I say, should be the onely wigh, That feeles the Beames of this cleare Suns sweet light; That in his armes he should enioy alone, Susanna, a fit Bride for Salomon."
21455,"Let vs bethink's of some conuenient tide, Our selues in some close shady place to hide, And take her in he Orchard all alone, For there she walketh eury afternoone: Thee, when we see our opotunitie, Keepe thou the dooe, Ile keepe Her company, And when I satisfide haue my desire, As I did mine, thou mayst asswage thy fire: Thus wickedly one with another reason, Deferring all to more conuenient season."
21456,The end of the first Booke.
21457,The second Booke of Susanna.
21458,"Susans devotions, workes and Husewifery, Ioachims iustice, hospitality."
21459,"Elders her washing tempt; but she denyes: They offer force, then out for ayde she cryes▪ On her transferre they▪ falsly, all the blame, Vnto her owne, and all her seruants shame."
21460,"Now scarce his steedes had Phebus watered, And for long iourney ready harnessed, And faire Aurora vsher of the day Made haste; because Sol went his longest way, When chaste Susanna from sweete side arose Of Ioachim, and putting on her cloathes, She meditates on oabe of righteousnesse."
21461,"Wherewith the bridegroome his belou'd doth dresse: His merits made her owne by imputation, In spirituall birth, nor fleshly generation."
21462,"Long costly dressings did the Dame decline, As nurse of pride and mis-expence of time, Wherefore her nightgowe quicke at out her cast, With band and hat in seemely order plac't, She suddainely vp all her maidens calls, And kneeling with them to this prayer falls."
21463,Oh King of rest!
21464,"that doest appoint the night For rest; the day that man should in thy sight, To all the duties of his calling tend, Hauing thy glory euer for his end; We first acknowledge our vnworthinesse, Relying whole, on Lambs vnspottednesse, Which from worlds first foundation was slaine."
21465,That he might free vs from eternall paie.
21466,"We, for this wondrous grace, thee euer praise, Thy care and prouidence for vs alwayes, Grant we of this may euer meditate, Our tongues thy praise & noble acts relate, And make vs truely doe all thy commands, So thou the workes maist prosper of our hands."
21467,"As nimble larke which with the morne doth rise, Mouts from her couch, first to salute the skies, And all the way to Heauen and earth she rings, Prayse to the Lord of Lords and King of Kings: But, hauing finished her due devotion, Falls silent downe with swift and nimble motion, And diligent takes paines for daily foode, That may sustaine and keepe her selfe and broode: Eu'n so this Dame as soone as any light, Affoorded her the least vse of her sight, Vp from the bed doth her faire body raise, Her soule mounts vp to heau'n the Lord to praise."
21468,"But after her devotions finished, And all her seruants duely ordered, Due portions to her maidens she divides And for her houshold daily food provides, Still caring for her husbands table most, To furnish't bounteously with smallest cost: Here she directs her steward, and her cooke, One to provide, the other well to looke, That with her faire allowance they be able, To furnish plenteously her husbands table."
21469,"This time she soueraigne waters did distill, (For she in Physicke art had mickle skill; Yet was her charity, than cunning, more, Stooping to heale the meanest Lazars sore: Her Lyons heart, fine hand, and eagles eye Made her admir'd of all for surgery.)"
21470,"That done, she backe returneth to her maides, Where either she to them the Scripture reades, Or learnes them some choise precepts she collected, Or hystories which most her soule affected, With piety their minds to exercise Whilst each her taske with nimble ioints applies: Their chiefest workes were roabes; to keepe frō cold, The orphans poore, and widowes that were old; Of cloath which she had spun of her owne fleece; Yet oft to shew her skill in curious peece, She for her husband workes a cap or band, To make him be more honour'd in the land, Where thou might see, with cunning needle told, The subtile serpent simple Eue infold."
21471,"Here stands a tree, all couered with leaues, whose fairest fruit most lookers on deceiues; By this was shadow'd that Forbidden tree, That Adam ban'de and his posteritee."
21472,"Many faire trees she planted there around, But none so goodly to the eye was found, Like sinne of pleasing shew, but deadly tast; Better, than eate such poison, euer fast."
21473,"But not farre off, her cunning hand contriues An Antidote which out this poison driues: For here the child's depainted to the life, That trembleth vnder faithfull Abrams knife, Where lo!"
21474,"aboue his hand an Angell stayes, And doth his faith and firme obedience praise: Here in the bush a spotlesse lambe doth lye, Willing, to saue young Isaacks life, to dye; A figure of that lambe that offered His life to saue vs all in Isaacks seede."
21475,"Oft with her maids, about her round, she sings Dauids sweete layes vnto the King of Kings, Who ioyning all with angelique sweete noise, Doe praise the Highest of all as with one voice, Thus was her house of maidens arts the schoole, And Academy to instruct their soule: Her hands with vse so cunning were become, That though her eyes lookd off, her worke was done, The whilst with them her maidens she directs, And her owne businesse no whit neglects: Oft reads she them some holy Hymne of praise, Yet neuer from their worke her fingers stayes."
21476,"Thus she her time in working spends till noone, Whilst Ioachim which rose from bed as soone, Doth his whole family together call, And ioynes in humble prayer with them all."
21477,"Then walkes he forth to see his oxen plow, Or mowers pearly lockes of medowes mow, Or widows weeding of his earing graine, Or maidens milke from bagges of kine to straine: Here he appoints a iolly Swaine to tend His flocke, and from the wolfe and flye defend: Oft would he teach a courser for to pace More easy, and to raine with pleasing grace."
21478,"But euer he returneth home by eight, Where many longing Clyents for him waite, And him for pitty and compassion praid, To be the widowes and the orphans aide."
21479,"Brethren, saith he, with all my skill and might I'le stand for you, if that your cause be right, But surely know, I cannot mooue my tongue To doe you good, and doe another wrong: Law is a constant will, a ballance true That giues to eu'ry man what is his due, And therefore must not vnder false pretence, Be made a cloake for wrong or violence: Or be for enuy, to the great a snare, Whilst faults for pitty in the Poore we spare: Right setteth each thing in the proper place, Without respect of persons, feare, or grace."
21480,"Then would he lend to all a patient eare, Till each his cause in order doth declare: The right with all his might he would defend, And what was wrong would counsell soone to end: Nor for displeasure, feare of losse or might, Would be deterr'd from pleading for the right."
21481,Therefore was call'd the iust mans Advocate▪ Truth's Champion▪ and maintainer of the State.
21482,"For paire thus each their life in labour spends One feedes and cloths them th'other them defends: The wisemans rule is vnto both a guide, Prepare abroade, then things at home prouide: A blessed paire, for Truth which alwayes stood, Their end Gods glory, and their neighbours good."
21483,"Now had the glorious Titans panting horse Attaind the midway of their longest course, And Sol to checke vaine glorious humane pride, When as he highest sate was least descride; When Chimes inform'd old stomacks it was noone, So Iudges rose, and all departed soone: And Nature crauing after toile repast, Makes Ioachim vnto his dinner hast."
21484,"Here should my Muse in order, next propound, How he in order all things ready found; Susan him greeting, like the wise Kings Bride, With many faire chaste Damsels by her side, Who all with cheerefull comely modest face, Bow to the ground with curteous comely grace▪ His seruants round about the table stand, Attending all their Lords eye, and command: Who can describe the order of the King, Whose wisedomes glorious fame so far did ring, That it from Seba brought that prudent Dame, Which found his glory farre exceede his fame: He to describe the order's onely able, This noble man obserued at his table; His seruants, ministers, his drinke and meate Happy were they that at his table eate; Blissed are they that waiting by doe stand, His gracious words and deeds to vnderstand, Their thirst and hunger being satisfide, And God before and after glorifide, After some sweete discourses, all arose, And to their businesse themselues dispose, turnes his bookes the law to find, Which might resolue some doubts then in his mind."
21485,"With two maydes Susan, as it was her guise, To bathe her sele into the orchard hyes; And sending forth her maides for soape and oile Her daintiest body doth vndresse the while: Oh, Susan stay, oh, stay not here alone, The wiseman saith, two better are than one; The close in wait for thee do ly, So that Susan can them not descry."
21486,"I that faire Dame which Iesses son from high, her selfe in garden did espy, dazled with her splendour bright, Thinkes he doth see a new Sunne rise at night: So shines the beauty of Susannas face, Her eyes like starres which frosty night do grace, Her teeth like ivory piles stand row by row, Or'e which her lips like scarlet ribbands show, Her chin, her checkes, her forehead and her nose, Like lillies mixt with red and damaske rose."
21487,"Her Iu'ry necke, faire shoulders which excell, Her paps that like two haruey apples swell: The which for sport her babes were wont to cull, When they from them haue suckd their bellies ull."
21488,"Her snowy armes each grac'd with milk-white palme, Like two eu'n branches of the fairest Palme, Whose ends were with small fingers ioynted neate, And at their ends smooth stones of Berill set, The rest who knowes?"
21489,"them to omit I chuse, As not once thought of by my graver Muse."
21490,"But she into the water leaping light, To coole her heate, inflameth their delight, Where purest waters her faire limbs embrace, As Iuory Sculpture in a cristall case."
21491,"Like chastest Cinthia when with dreaded dart, She chast the Tigre, Leopard and Hart, Her body ouertoiled with the heate, And fairest skin or'e shadowed with sweate, In purest fountaine in the shade doth wash, Whilst all her darlings round about her pash: Till hunter, to his cost her beauty spyes Which heauenly did amaze his humane eyes: The sight whereof so rauisheth his brest, A reasonable man turnes senselesse beast, With snaggy hornes, cloue hoofes, & frighted looks, That he who vpward erst, now downeward lookes; And all his Curs, that lately he so fed, Him chasing as their game fast followed: Whom pulling downe, like Iesabel they teare, Such beastly ends, all beastly Letchers feare; Such beastly ends these Elders eke befall, Whilst clouds of stones sing their curst funerall."
21492,"As subtile Serpent close himselfe did hide In Eden, till a fit time he espide, When Adam to some other corner gone, He there might take Eue naked all alone: So these two Elders of the Serpents breede, Who beare like enmity to all her seede, This naked Dame alone, watch to assaile, And first with promises seeke to preuaile: Madame, saith one, the ardour which we prooue Burning our hearts with flames of feruent loue, Compell vs life and honour to aduenture, And closely now into your garden enter: If you will vs in true affection meete, Siluer to you shall be like stones in streete, And we with gold will fill your fairest hands Like Danaes lap, or Tagus golden sands: Thy beauty like the Day starres shall be seene, And thou shalt raigne in Iudah like a Queene."
21493,"But if thou shalt refuse with vs to lye, Behold, we then against thee testify, VVe saw thee with a youth thy bed defile, And thou hadst sent thy maides away the while."
21494,"VVho can expresse Daphnes perplexitie, VVhen gods for pitty turn'd her to a tree, As she doth naked from Apollo flye, And than her honour lose, would rather dye?"
21495,"Or who can tell that pittifull sore-taking Of Absolons faire sister, when she baking Cakes for her brother Amnon for to eate,2."
21496,Perceiu'd her honour was his longd-for meate?
21497,"And cride, forbeare, oh brother, to discouer Thy sisters nakednesse; nay rather couer My shame than force me: oh!"
21498,let no man tell Such wickednesse was done in Israel; And I eu'n whither shall I goe for shame?
21499,"And for a foole all Israel shall thee blame: May tell how Helchi's daughter was ashamd; But most the Elders for their lust she blam'd, That they which ought to iudge adultery, Should authours be of such iniquity; That those her Lord and she so honoured, Should plot with shame now to defile his bed."
21500,"Her nakednesse with cloathes she faine would hide, But they all couering to her denide: Her couering was sorrow, griefe and shame, And floods of teares for to expresse the same."
21501,"As when fierce thunder threats to rend the skies, Great floods by stormes most violent arise, That riuers all their channells ouerflow, And drowne the seede which husbandmen do sow, So fill her teares the lauer to the brim, That drown'd in sorrow, she in teares may swim: Her drops of sweate like pearles do trickle downe, And she is all benumbd as in a swoune: Sol, erst that shin'd, asham'd, now in a cloud Himselfe, from seeing this foule sinne, doth shrowd: Showres fall from heau'n, as if the stars did mourne, And all the birds their songs to murmurs turne: The trees small drops like teares about do das, And all the vnder shrubs with weeping wash; The shrubs, the hearbs, and all make lamentation, To see this Dame so neere her desolation: And eu'n my Muse, as I this story write, Laments and mournes to see her piteous plight."
21502,"At last ore grieu'd that humane eye beholds Her naked body, she her mind vnfolds."
21503,"My Lords for loue of God, this sinne forbeare, If not for loue nor honour, yet for feare, When you condemne another for this crime, You iudge your selues!"
21504,"Tis now a fitter time, To fast and pray in our captiuity, Than thus to double our iniquity."
21505,"If I like Eue consent vnto your mind, I sure with her a like reward shall find▪ And if I doe your wickednes withstand, Yet know I not how to escape your hand: But I all mortall deaths will rather dy, Than in Gods sight commit adultery: Who doth with lust her laser lims enroule, Defiles her body, and doth damme her soule: Haue I not promis'd before God and you, To be vnto my husband iust and true?"
21506,And must not all by lawes iudiciall dye?
21507,Without exception for adultery?
21508,"Oh Iudges graue: but bridle yet your lust, And once a womans Secrecy entrust, That neuer will bewray this offerd shame, For honour of our nation and your name."
21509,"But howsoeuer you my flesh torment, My heart to wickednesse shall not consent, A guilty conscience is a soarer wound, Than tortures all that Tyrants out haue found."
21510,"Dame; said the Iudge; art thou yet so vnwise, Thou knowst not Polititians did deuise Religion, onely to represse the base, And hold the Noble in the peoples grace?"
21511,Dost feare God should vs in this action see?
21512,"This Lawyers gowne shall couer thee and me; Vnder which oft to Heau'n hath past vnseene, Farre greater Trespasses then this, I weene▪ Lust is a Sport, if closely carried, And from all fleshly eyes close couered; The Troth which to your husband you did plight, Was but for ceremony in our Sight."
21513,"And as for our iudiciall Laws offence, Iudges haue power therewith to dispence: Your selfe and honour vnto vs entrust, And you shall find vs faithfull, true, and iust▪ Great is the honour of an Elders name, Then who shall dare or thee or vs defame?"
21514,"And for your conscience now so foolish tender, Custome like ours, will strong and valiant render: Weele not torment your flesh, but it delight, Come, Madame, you must try an Elders might."
21515,"Then, like fowle Beare, that greedy of his pray, His filthy Paw on milke-white Lamb doth lay, So he by force would bring her to his Lust."
21516,"But she that in th' Almightie put her trust, Needes no Stilletto, now for to defend Her honour, but loud cries to heau'n doth send; ""Surest defence that women haue to cry, ""To saue them from Lusts raging villany."
21517,"You females-masculine, that doe pretend, You weapons weare your honours to defend, If in the Court or City, villany, Should be attempted 'gainst your chastity: See here this naked woman all alone, Defends her honour hauing two to one."
21518,"Her modest Lookes were late her sure defence, 'Gainst base attempts, now cries 'gainst violence."
21519,"Oh modell of a chaste and constant Dame, The world all chaste ones, hence Susannas name."
21520,"Eue tempted was, and by temptation fell, Faire Thamar forced was against her will, Sarah was tane away, but neuer tride; Shames Feare made Lucrece yeild, whereof she dide."

21522,"But one of them, ah!"
21523,"uddainely doth run To the fore-gate, which he hath sone vndone, And comming backe, both 'gainst the woman cry, Stop, stop the adulterour, they both must dye."
21524,"The Seruants much affrighted with the noise, And knowing well the heard their Ladies voice, Rushing in at the back-dore, found their Dame, Accused by the Elders to their shame."
21525,"cride the one of them, fie, fie, Is this thy modest holy Puritie?"
21526,"Thy Prayer, Fasting, Almes, and Meditation, Sabboths, and New-moones, holy obseruation, With which thou seekst thy wickednesse to couer?"
21527,God now will thy Hypocrisie discouer.
21528,"Thy piteous lookes, and faind strict Conscience Shall be no Subterfuge for foule offence; Was this the cause thou forth thy maids didst send?"
21529,"More closely with a young man to offend; We as true witnesses, doe testifie, That thou art taken in Adulterie, Thy Minion we doe hope to catch ere long, Who brake from vs because he was too strong: For testimony, open see the doore, Through which he scap't, that was close spard before▪ And see her naked, as with him she lay, Lo here for heate her garments laid away."
21530,"The Seruants all were grieu'd and much asham'd▪ To heare their Dame thus by the Elders blam'd, For enuious Fame durst neuer till that day, Least Spot or Blemish on Susanna lay."

21532,THE THIRD BOOKE OF SVSANNA.
21533,"True Louers greeting, willinger to dye, Than suspect mutuall integritie; An old-man into talke of Susan fals, And her describes from birth to nuptials: She is brought forth; arraign'd, condemn'd to dye, God her deliuers, soone as she doth cry."
21534,"NOw clouds black curtaines vnder Heau'n were spread, And Morne was all in Scarlet manteled, (For chaste Aurora put on this array, To shew the horrour of this bloudy day:) When Elders from their Beds of Downe arise, Who nought but mischiefe all the night deuise; And send their Serieants out to summon all The people to assemble at the Hall."
21535,"Their Loue was turned now to Indignation, Their Lust to mischieuous Imagination, And Hostile-like since they may not enioy Her Fort by parley, seeke it to destroy."
21536,"But here chaste Susan doth my Muse inuite To tell, how with her Lord she spent that night: Who hearing in his study at his Booke, A wondrous noise, doth from his window looke; But when he thence but little could discerne, For shade of trees, comes downe the Truth to learne."
21537,"As whn great Ebers Sonne, (to saue his life, Her,Gen."

21556,"Scarse had the Sunne twelue times through Virgo past, When faire Susannas manners sweete, were cast, By care of Parents, in so faire a mould, That all with wonder did the maide behold: In publique Dancing she doth not delight, Faires, banquets, plays, or sittings vp at night, Nor yet in wandring Dinas conuersation, But keepes at home her fathers habitation: Imploying all her paines and carefull thought, To please and tend on them that vp her brought."
21557,"Like, Storke who when her parents old haue neede, Sustaines in Eld, who her in youth did feede; Accounting it a wondrous happinesse, For gifts receiu'd to render thankfulnesse."
21558,"At vacant houres it was her chiefe delight, To reade the stories of Gods glorious might, Where all the choisest precepts she could find, She stor'd as heau'nly Manna for her mind: The Liues of choisest Dames of Iewish nation, To her as patternes are for imitation, Which oft with needle, lest she should forget, She in most curious Colours neately set."
21559,"Here in a table she doth tell the story, Of Egypts ouerthrowe, and Iudas glory, Where Miriam leades her Daughters in a dance, To sing Heau'ns Prayses for Deliuerance: The Red Sea here his waters doth diuide, Whilst Israel passeth to the other side; And here the waues begin to meete againe, To drowne the proud Egyptians in the maine: One breakes, but knowes not how, his Charet wheele, Anothers horse doth of the staggers reele; Here one yet without hope of Life, doth swim, Another siing catcheth hold on him, And neuer lets him goe, till he him straine, nto he late-ry bottome of the Maine."

21563,"Then would She wish her Father such a crosse, So both thereby might haue no greater losse: Oft sings she to her Lute diuinest Layes, And oft to make sweet Hymns her selfe assaies, So that indeede to win her for his Bride, Young Princes sought, but she them all deuide."
21564,"Thus woo'd of all, but yet Loues fiery dart, Could neuer thaw the chaste ye of her heart, But like a Diamond, which nothing but A Diamond is able for to cut, So nothing could this peerelesse Lady moue, But pairelesse Ioachims most constant Loue: The yron easelier from beloued Side, Of Loade-stone than their Loues you might diuide: ""For as words cut in Diamonds, ay last, ""So Loue on vertue grounded standeth fast, ""When that which onely doth on Lust depend, ""Doth like to Ammons with the Fury end."

21572,"As when the course of some much honour'd peere, Vnto her tombe is brought vpon a Beere, Couer'd with veluet blacke downe to the ground, Her friends and kins-folkes all about her round, Their late delights now all to Sorrow turne; But most her parents and her children mourne, For losse of their deare childe, and carefull mother, Who neuer had, nor shall haue such another: That all the lookers on and standers by, Bewaile the last act of this Tragedie: So was this Dame brought out in blacke array, Vnto the funerall of this sad day, Her faire blacke stole low-reaching to the ground, Vnder which heau'nly Beauties all abound, Follow'd by noble Dames of Iwish nation, Who made for her exceeding Lamentation: Ya, so her parents and her children mourne, It doth all Iudas hearts to pittie turne; Yet would the Elders Bowels not relent, Thugh eu'n the rockes and stones seeme to lament."
21573,"And sure none can the ashes in an vrne, Bewaile more than they all for her doe mourne: Herein the difference doth only lye, A Corse is dead, and Susan is to dye."
21574,"One's Soule is whole in heauenly habitation, Hers there as yet only by contemplation."
21575,"The Elders burning in old lustfull fire, To satisfie their beastly Lusts desire, Command the Serieants streight her face vncouer, And at the Barre the prisoner plaine discouer."
21576,"As when the Coffin which the Coarse containes, With blacke all couer'd, on the Herse remaines, The mourners seeme their loud Laments to hould, But when the Sexton doth the Same vnfould, Preparing it for earths last habitation; All send out loudest groanes and Lamentation; So all her friends this liuing Coarse bewaile."
21577,"When from her tender eyes they pull the vaile, Her Face then vnder Sorowes clouds doth shine, As neere as mortals may, like to diuine; Her haire like wires of burnisht gold appeares, Whereon like pearles do hang her cristall teares."

21736,"TO THE RIGHT HONOVRA∣BLE AND REVEREND FA∣THER IN GOD, GEORGE, LORD Bishop of London, Lord high ALMENER to the Kings most Excellent MAIESTIE."
21737,"TO me thy Fauour, to thee my Relation Doe tie mee in a double Obligation: These Graces fiue to thee to dedicate, Which best I think thy worth accommodate; Who art the bounteous Almener of the King Of Bounty; whose great wisdome did thee bring For thy large spirit, and well tempred zeale His Temples broken head and sides to heale: Whose loue to Knowledge Humane & Diuine, As in the Schooles, so in the Church doth shine."
21738,"These outward Vertues: plainly doe declare, What inward Graces in thee likewise are: The chiefe is spirituall Ioy; which in thy Breast, God make thee feele, as wee doe see the rest."
21739,To Reuerend Diuines.

21749,THE BRIDES ORNAMENTS.
21750,I. Of Heauenly KNOWLEDGE.
21751,"A Daily warfare is a Christians life, Where Souldiers all, not onely stand in need Of Armes and Valour (to maintaine the strife The cursed Serpent makes with Adams seed) But of this Treasure, Knowledge, both to feed Their Soules with food most pure Celestiall, And furnish with such Weapons as they need; I therefore her Loues Treasurer doe call, For we in daily want stand of her Treasure all."
21752,"By feigned Treasure; did the Serpent traine Our two first Parents to their cursed sinne; Pretending they should goodly treasure gaine, And Knowledge, both of good and euill, win: But good doth end, where euill doth begin; For drosse they doe exchange their purest gold."
21753,"The Serpent bad without, themselues within They find the euill, as the Serpent told: But vp to Heav'n flies good, which can no ill behold."
21754,"Thus all our Treasures lost we had before, The Knowledge of Gods nature and his will, And we become vnarm'd, rude, naked, poore; Of all things ignorant, but doing ill: Now vs our enemies may easily kill, We hauing lost our weapons and our treasure: Which wealth and weapons if regaine we will, We must attend this heau'nly Ladys pleasure; Diuine sweet Knowledge not confin'd by weight or measure."
21755,Thou Word incarnate!
21756,"whom aright to know Is Life eternall, Ioy and happy rest, To mee this Ladies wondrous Beautie show, And richest treasures, which in golden Chest."
21757,"Thou hid'st from Hell and malice of the Beast; Knowledge, contain'd in either Testament: Wherein thy Will and Nature is exprest How we should liue and Serpents sting preuent, How conquer Hell, and serue thee with a true intent."
21758,"Some Knowledge call, th'habit of demonstration, Some her to know by causes doe define; Some  Wee her to heau'nly Doctrine here confine: Which in a threefold Booke to man doth shine, Of  The Booke of Creatures shewes Gods power diuine, The Law is much in types and shadowes spent, Whereof the Gospel is the full accomplishment."
21759,"In Booke of creatures, all men may obserue  By which he made the world and doth preserue In truest motions, its circumference: Sending from Heav'n raines sweetest influence; Filling our hearts with Mirth and Ioyfulnesse; And giuing all things, Motion, Being, Sense: This doth Gods power and God-head plaine expresse; But not his Will, which leads to endlesse happinesse."
21760,"Yet by this Booke are left without excuse Idolaters, who downe to stocks doe fall; Which their owne hands haue made for such abuse, And leaue their Maker, blessed ouer all; Who as his Power and Goodnesse generall Appeares most plainly in this Worlds Creation; So doth his gracious Bountie on them fall, In sending food for daily sustentation, And in their healths and liues continuall preseruation; The next two Bookes, most plainly doe disclose Gods will particular, and generall, Particular to Patriarchs, Prophets, those That till Christs time, on God aright did call: For this did not on all the Nations fall, Gods will was then in Iury onely knowne: But now the Gospel soundeth out to all, The seed thereof in eu'ry Nation's sowne, Which doth reueale hid mysteries before vnknowne."
21761,"The first, Gods power and prouidence doth shew; The second, types out our Regeneration; The third, directly leadeth vs to know All that is needfull, for our owne Saluation; Ev'n from Election to Glorification: This Booke reueales all secret mysteries, Hidden in Christ, before the Worlds foundation; Though worldlings this, as folly doe despise, Yet this true Knowledge onely happy, makes and wise."
21762,"As some great Princes might and Maiestie, Is often to the meanest stranger knowne; But his most secret counsell and decree, To friends and counsellours is onely showne."
21763,"Ev'n so the King of Kings holds not vnknowne From Heathens sight, his Maiestie and might: But hath disclosed onely to his owne, The secret of his counsells, and delight; Whereby they may him worship, please, and serue aright."
21764,"This is the Knowledge which I seeke to trace, This onely doth true happinesse affoord, Whereof the onely cause is inward Grace, And vnderstanding Gods most holy Word: The helpes which humane Learning doe record;  Are but as seruants waiting on their Lord, And hand-maids to their dame Diuinitie; All Knowledge without this is foolish vanitie."
21765,"Sweet Grace, which dost true Knowledge of Gods will, To Babes and sucklings oftentimes reueale, When from great Clerkes of Wisdome and deepe skill, Thy pleasure is this treasure to conceale; Oh sacred breath!"
21766,"which in our hearts doth steale, Like sweetest Zephyrus most pleasing wind, Whence no man knowes, yet doth it surely seale, That certaine Knowledge which I seeke to find,  of mankind."
21767,"All Graces that doe serue Loues Royall Queene From heauenly Knowledge haue their maintenance, And alwayes in her company are seene, None without Knowledge may neere Loue aduance; With her are Diligence, and Temperance: True Faith so neere her euer doth attend, You would her take for Knowledge at a glance, Though often Faith doth so her selfe transcend, That shee beyond the reach of Knowledge doth ascend."
21768,"Not Faith alone, but Workes accompany True Knowledge, who in words doth make profession He knowes God, but in Workes doth him deny, Is ev'n a lyar by his owne confession; How many from this rule doe make digression?"
21769,"That would in Knowledge be accounted high, But giue themselues to Pride, Lust, and Oppression; Enuy, dissembling, Schisme, Idolatry Alas true Knowledge neuer kept such company."
21770,"Some onely seeke to know, that they may know; And this is foolish curiositie, And some of Learning make a goodly show, And this is base and idle vanitie: Some Knowledge seeke for their vtilitie, Or their preferment, which is filthy gaine, Some to teach other, which is Charitie, Some by this Knowledge seeke Heav'n to attaine, To know and walke not right is damnable and vaine."
21771,"I liken this true Knowledge to the flower, Or blossome springing from the root of Grace, That doth most gloriously adorne Loues bower, And fills with pleasant odours all the place: Which blossome beautifull, in little space, It selfe into most goodly fruits doth spend, Faith, Mercy, Peace each good and perfect grace, Which fruit so farre the flower doth transcend, God, Men, and Angels tast it, and the same commend."
21772,"As Blossomes doe not from root liuely spring, That after blowing, haue a fruitlesse fall; So Knowledge that in Workes is vanishing, Had neuer any root from grace at all."
21773,"But is like to good seed, that's said to fall From sowers hand, downe by the high-way side, Whose rooting being shallow, loose, and small, Could not the Suns hot scorching heat abide; But in the blade, with some, small light affliction dide."
21774,"Some liken heau'nly Knowledge to the Sunne, Then which in this world nothing more to sight Obiected is: But we by Sinne become, Like him borne blind, depriu'd of naturall light."
21775,"Till some Power supernaturall enlight, And though more plaine in this world nothing's showne, Than Gods eternall God-head, goodnesse, might; Yet vntill Grace enlighten 'tis vnknowne, No cause hereof in God, but in our selues is knowne."
21776,"Knowledge is like the talents which the Lord, When he went forth did to his seruants lend: The first who his one talent vp did hoard, Like him, that for his Knowledge doth contend; But therewith not himselfe, nor others mend: Hee that with talents two, gain'd other twaine; Is he that doth his time and labour spend To saue himselfe, and those with him remaine, But he that gaind the fiue; seeks all mens soules to gaine."
21777,"I Knowledge to the Virgins Lamps compare, Which foolish maids had common with the Wise, Oile workes of Pietie and Mercy are; Which foolish Virgins idlely doe misprise, But when one, Loe the Bridegrome comes, out cryes, The foolish Virgins Lamps are spent and done, Wherefore they must to merits merchandize, And borrow when they of their owne haue none, The Churches Treasury will furnish ev'ry one."
21778,"Like Widowes Oile, that doth encrease by spending, Like flames, that lightning others, gaine more light."
21779,"Like Vsurers coine, that doth augment by lending; Like Ioy, that most encreaseth by delight."
21780,"Like Manna that the Angels food is hight, Whereof each gathers what may him suffice: Except such as in Flesh-pots more delight, Like Springs which more you draw, the faster rise, Like Tutors, who by teaching Schollers, grow more wise."
21781,"No Simile can her so well expresse, As infinite and boundlesse treasury; Or Sea of waters which become no lesse: Though Fountaines all with streames it doth supply."
21782,"How infinite is this grand mystery, To lay of nothing this huge Worlds foundation: One God, three persons in the Trinitie, Oh depth of Knowledge!"
21783,"Gods owne Incarnation,  Oh!"
21784,"I am drown'd, here Elephants may swim, My Lambe-like Muse in shallow Fords must wade, And seeke for Knowledge to desist from Sinne, And make Faith, Mercy, Pietie my trade."
21785,"By Faith, I know, Christs merits mine are made; The rest are-fruits of my Sanctification, Abundant Knowledge doth with sorrow lade, To Know and doe God's willis delectation, And onely by Christs merits bringeth to Saluation."
21786,"This is the Knowledge which our Sauiour meant, When as he it eternall life did call; To know God, and the Christ which he had sent: This is the Knowledge so much sought of all, Before and since the Law, and euer shall, Though till Christs time, it was so shadowed; As couer'd it in types and signes seem'd small, But since Times fulnesse is accomplished, Behold, they all in Christ are easie to be read."
21787,"By this did Abel offer of his Sheepe, The fat, and God accepted his oblation: By this so well Gods Law did Henoch keepe, Hee him exalted from earths habitation; For this did Abram Ieaue both house and Nation, Assured, that from out his Loines should spring That Knowledge, which to know was his saluation Herein did Dauid, though he were a King, Take more delight than Crowne, or any worldly thing."
21788,"See next his royall sonne, King Salomon, Then whom arise a Wiser neuer shall, Who knew plants natures, eu'n from Lebanon Her Caedars tall to Hysope by the wall: Who as in Wealth in Knowledge passed all; Yet after hee had traced Uanitie, And found how sonnes of men thereby did fall."
21789,Him to this Knowledge did againe apply: And swanlike sang Christs Churches Epithalamy.
21790,"Wake I, or sleepe, or am I in a trance?"
21791,Or doe another Salomon behold?
21792,"A Dauid who doth far and wide aduance, His gracious scepter?"
21793,"But no bounds can hold His Knowledge, secret things for to vnfold; Law, History, Arts and Philosophy, All noble sciences that can be told, Yet seemes to loue alone Diuinitie."
21794,Which truely can direct in Peace to liue and die.
21795,"Who as hee is the Learnedest of Kings, So 'tis his Ioy and Glory for to be, The King of learned men; which in all things, Makes God to prosper him as all may see, This makes him raise to place of high degree, Men of great knowledge, well to rule the Land, And put downe Ignorance and subtiltie, Which highest in their owne conceits doe stand; Long sway thou Brittons Scepter with thy sacred hand."
21796,"And when thy Cloake, Elias-like, must fall Vpon Elisha thine vndoubted heire, Inherite hee thy Peace and Knowledge all, And in thy Spirit rule as in thy chaire: But I must leaue this field so ample faire, Teach mee, O Lord, to know and doe thy will, And let thy grace againe in me repaire Thine Image lost, and all corruptions kill; Thus we thy will on Earth, as they in Heav'n fulfill."
21797,"This knowledge must stand by vs at our last, When as wee ready are our soules to tender To him, that for false knowledge curious tast, Though guiltlesse did his life to Iustice render: For this the Holy Ghost doth more commend her, That bare her Sauiours knowledge in her brest; Than that shee bare him in her wombe; yet tender, For One all Generations call her blest, By th'other one of his true members shee doth rest."
21798,"But though this onely necessary is, And first for our saluation to be sought, Wee onely at our last of it haue misse, As too meane subiect for ambitious thought: Thus the vnlearned rise, and heav'n haue cought, When greatest Clerks with Sciences profound, Heartlesse, and comfortlesse to Hell are brought, For God doth their great wisedome oft confound, Because their inward parts are not sincere and sound."
21799,"of knowledge here we haue no care, But all our youth in follies idely spend; Our strength in lusts and strifes away we weare; In age we worldly profit all intend: Alas what gaine we by this at our end?"
21800,"When our fraile Body doth returne to dust, Our Soule to him that gaue it must ascend, Whereof least iot of time account they must, Which hath been spent in discord, profit, folly, lust."
21801,knew we but the vertue of this treasure?
21802,"Like to the Merchant wise, we would sell all To buy it, where we should find profit, pleasure, Such Ioy as neuer on our hearts did fall: Oh heav'nly Comfort!"
21803,"Ioy spirituall: Delight vnspeakeable in hearts that' grow, Of those that shee is conuersant withall; What Ioy can there be greater than to know Gods endlesse Loue in Christ, which shee to vs doth show."
21804,"Sure I could wish my whole life here to spend, In this diuine most holy contemplation, whereof I know not how to make an end, Shee yeelds such plentie of sweet meditation: Most heav'nly mysteries of our Creation, Wherein appeare Gods might and Maiestie; But aboue all his loue in mans saluation This is that wondrous hidden mystery, Into the which eu'n Angels did desire to pry."
21805,"But we confesse though thou dost here reueale, Abundant knowledge, yet we little know Wherefore 'gainst vs the Heathen may appeale Who though thou didst to them but glimpses show Of Truth, and Iustice, did more righteous grow, Than wee that doe thy sacred Truth confesse; And make of Puritie a glorious show; But to adorne the Gospel we professe With workes of Charitie, Ah!"
21806,wee doe nothing lesse.
21807,"Oh it is meate and drinke, we know not of; To know and doe our heav'nly Fathers will: Our blessed Sauiour alwayes fed thereof, And hereof Saints and Angells eate their fill."
21808,"These are the fruitfull plants which flourish still,  Which doe refresh Christs Spouse when shee is ill: These richest Iewells, which her make so fine, Locks, Ribands, Roses, which so gloriously do shine."
21809,"For this, shee is the Bridegroomes darling Doue, And vnto her that bare her, onely deare: For this the daughters, when they see her loue, And all the Queenes and Wiues make merry cheere: This makes her looke than Sunne and Moone more cleere."
21810,"Her nauell, belly, head, necke, brests adorne; With these shee to her husband doth appeare, More beautifull, than is the fairest morne; Or faire like twinning Ews, on Gilead washt and shorne."
21811,"Thou that such heav'nly Knowledge didst instill, Into plaine Fishers that they could confound By argument, ev'n Clerkes of greatest skill, And diue into thy Mysteries profound: Who by their clouen-fiery tongues forth sound, The Knowledge of thy Truth to ev'ry Nation; Canst make this Knowledge in mine heart abound, By one, sparke of diuine illumination, And rauish my weake soule with heav'nly admiration."
21812,"And though imperfect here our Knowledge be, By reason of our humane imperfection, And for by Faith alone, we things doe see, And nothing know indeed in true perfection; Yet when thy Spirit cleares our minds infection, Wee shall then know, ev'n as we now are knowne; And things now seene, by mirrour-like inspection; To vs shall be most euidently showne, In Knowledge we shall reape, what we in Faith haue sowne."
21813,"What then's imperfect, shall be done away, Knowledge shall perfect our felicitie; Which is our free beholding God, for ay, In his great Goodnesse, Loue, and Maiestie, So farre as finite may infinitie, Farther to reach my Muse dares not be bold, When Angels of so high sublimitie, Gods Light and Maiestie cannot behold, Finite with infinite can no proportion hold."
21814,I. Of ZEALE and godly IEALOVSIE.
21815,"OH that some holy fire enlightening, My Soule now rauish would with thoughts diuine, Whilst I of Iealousie, Loues daughter sing, And godly Zeale, which like the Sunne doth shine, Alas!"
21816,"Minerua, and the Muses nine, Are too weake helpes their aide here to intreate, With Colefrom Altar let some Seraphine Touch my rude tongue, and set my braine on heate, The Glory of this Grace in loftie rhimes to sweate."
21817,"Fit Subiect, for a sacred Poets Verse, Which should it selfe in Extasie transcend, Zeales sacred Praise, with Knowledge to rehearse Both Method and Deuotion doe commend: Who as the houshold Chaplaine doth intend, To all that liue in Royall Court of Loue; And Prayers for them all, to heau'n doth send, For without Zeale none possible can moue, To high Olimpus Court, the Seate of mightie Ioue."
21818,"For Prayers that to Heau'n seeke to ascend, Without the Feruour of this sacred Zeale, Fall downe like smoakie vapours, that intend Into Aires middle region to steale: But those that are supported by her seale Like Fumes of incense by the Lamb contend Eu'n in th'Almighties presence to reueale Our wants, and craue his aid vs to defend: 'Gainst worlds and Serpents poyson to our latest end."
21819,"thou, to whom it was both drinke and meate, To finish and to doe thy Fathers Will, Whom Zeale of Gods owne house eu'n vp did eate, And made thee on the Crosse thy bloud to spill: Who whipst out Merchants that thy house did fill, With doues and money, theeues and merchandize, Some Zea-lous iuice into my pen distill, And raise my mind aboue her wonted guise, That so my Muse may with her matter sympathise."
21820,"All other holy Graces disposition, By rules of Art I formerly define; But Zeale so feruent is no definition Can her containe, or bound in any line; Onely shee is by nature, pure, diuine, Beloued daughter to the Queene of Loue, Whose mothers Graces, so in her doe shine, Shee well the primate of her Court may proue, And ranked be for place, all other Peares aboue."
21821,"I here omit that Zeale, which without hate Of others, doth to vertuous deeds contend, And vs enflames that good to emulate, Which we to be in others apprehend: I here that holy Iealousie commend, Which onely doth from Loue diuine proceed; When, not for our, but Gods cause, we intend To loue both him and his in word and deed, For this is that right Zea'le which of true Loue doth breed."
21822,"Truth comes by knowledge, and from zeale, deuotions; When therefore zeale doth with true knowledge meete, Shee doth inlarge our hearts with heav'nly notions, Sublime, transcendant, admirable, sweet; But where this knowledge wants, shee's vndiscreet, Rash, violent, seditious, rude and blind, Faults for so faire a Lady farre vnmeet; You see two zeales here of a differing kind, I leaue the worst, and seeke the fairest out to find."
21823,"daughter to the Queene of Loue; Which is the cause of Zeale and Iealousie, If you will aske mee what this Queene doth moue, To loue vs wretches that in sin doe lye; I answere, Goodnesse of her Maiestie."
21824,"Most excellent is then this holy fire, Of zeale, proceeding from such ancestry, Goodnesse and Loue, which therefore wee require To true effects of Loue and Goodnesse to aspire."
21825,"How fairely dost thou beautifie Th'affection, where thou mak'st thy habitation, Like Temple, which thy Lord did purifie, When as his Soule with zeale and indignation, Was mou'd to see Gods Temples prophanation, Not suffering thy house of endlesse rest, To be abus'd by Pride or lustfull passion, Th'affection which doth lodge within my brest, The Temple where Christ and the Holy Ghost should rest."
21826,"Companions of Zeale are Pietie,  and Right, In workes of Mercy, Peace, and Charitie, And sweet Humilitie is her delight: With all her Power shee is opposite Against all that Gods glory may oppose, Shee spends in feruent Prayers, day and night; And those by Knowledge doth so well compose, They bring Gods blessings down, and vp his Iudgements close."
21827,"Oh Zeale with Knowledge, Faith and Charitie, Who able is thy vertue to commend, Which doth the Church into one Body tye, And for Gods glory onely dost contend: For publike good, and not for priuate end."
21828,"th' Angells-Being doth in zeale consist; Whose sacred ardour doth all flames transcend, Wherewith they oft enlight our minds darke mist, When flames of hottest zeale they to our soule suggest."
21829,"Loue as strong as Death and Iealousie, Cruell as graue: Thy flames like coales of fire Consume and burne vp all most violently, No Streames or Flouds can quench her sacred ire, Should we sell all we haue, we could not buy her: The Daughter zeale is like the Mother free, Them both from Heau'n th' Almightie doth inspire, And therefore neither will affronted bee, With Riualls, Heathen Gods most base Idolatree."
21830,"Fond Zeale that's fitly called which doth want Faith, Knowledge, Loue diuine, and Graces all, It still doth most vaine superstitions haunt, And to most base Idolatry doth fall, Vnhumane Fury; Madnesse tragicall!"
21831,"Of men, whom thus blind zeale and strange desire, Transports beyond rage diabolicall, To offer vp their children in the fire Of some offended deuill to appease the ire."
21832,"Strange is this zealous fury of the rude, When Ignorance doth guide their blind deuotion, The gathering of the froward multitude, When they be stirred with some feruent motion: All following some braine-sicke idle notion, With discontent, against authoritie, Raise  Pretending all their Conscience-liberty, Alas!"
21833,these be no fruits of holy Iealousie.
21834,"God often by an Anthropopathy, By which his nature best wee vnderstand, Ascribes vnto himselfe this Iealousie, As being link'd in Hymens holy band; Vnto his Church, his vndefiled: And His Church againe, to shew her feruent Loue, And Ioy shee takes in her new ioyned hand, Like Loue-sicke Bride the Bridegroome oft doth proue, And him with zeale inuites her to imbrace and Loue."
21835,"Neuer new wedded Bridegroome was more faine Of his new-Bride, than Christ is of his Doue, Neuer did truest Turtle more complaine, For losse of Mate, than this Spouse of her Loue; It would a stony heart to fountaines moue Of teares to heare the Churches piteous mone, When shee doth misse him whom her Soule doth loue,  And left his saddest Deare, to sigh and sit alone."
21836,"And therefore as a Signet on his heart, And as the Seale that is on his right hand, Shee would be ioyn'd, that shee might neuer part, But alwayes in his Grace and presence stand."
21837,"No Keeper in Christs Vineyard must command, Hee will his Vineyard prune and dresse alone, Whereby his Iealousie wee vnderstand, His Vine the Bridegroome will haue drest of none, The Bride out of his presence neuer will be gone."
21838,Doth mine inuention faile?
21839,"that wont to flow In Similes, that make hard things seeme plaine?"
21840,"Or doth the whole Creation here below, Nothing affoord zeales nature to explaine?"
21841,"Alas all earthly Similes are vaine T'expresse the nature of this Heau'nly fire, Which in the glorious Angells doth remaine, And in the Spirits of that blessed Quire, Which here with Hymnes and Praises doe Gods loue admire."
21842,"Shall dust and ashes dare yet be so bold, Her to the holy fire to compare Which in the Bush thy seruant did behold Flaming, but did the Bush not singe or seare: Such flames of zeale oft in our hearts there are, Which doe enlighten them, but not consume These flames our Prayers to Iehoua beare, By these our Praises spiritually vp fume, And in Gods nostrils are like incense and perfume."
21843,"Or shall I like her to some Lionesse Rob'd of her whelps, by some aduenturous hand, Who in her wondrous woe, and furiousnesse, Deuour's and slayes all in her way that stand: Who can the force of Iealousie withstand?"
21844,"Being of so great strength and wondrous might, God grant our zeale the Truth may vnderstand, And that true Knowledge may your minds inlight, To make vs zealous for Gods glory and the right."
21845,"May I not like her to strong churlish wine, Which doth confound the braine, inflame the blood: But cool'd with water pure, and sugar fine, For both of them is soueraigne and good: Eu'n so doth Iealousies most feruent mood, Allaid with sugar of sweet Charitie, And coold with sweetest Christalline pure floud, The silent streames of soft Humilitie, Transcend in all good workes, of Loue and Pietic."
21846,"This is the zeale and sacred emulation, Which the Originall doth signifie; Which hath with Loue in Heau'n her habitation, And all our actions here doth sanctifie, And when our Maker vs shall glorifie, Behold!"
21847,"our zeale shall in perfection shine, Begun on earth in true sinceritie, And as our Fleshly courage doth decline, Our zeale will grow more hot, and neerest to diuine."
21848,"Zeale made old Abram, Hagars sonne reiect, For scoffing at his holy promisd seed, And Moses Pharaohs Court and grace neglect, When hee th' Egyptians Destiny did reed, That smote a brother of the holy breed: This zeale made noble Phineas with his speare, Slay Zimry and Cosbi in their damned deed, Though Saul the fat of Amalec would spare; Yet Samuels zeale doth Agags flesh in pieces teare."
21849,"Oh had his Master Eli's burnt so hot Against his sonnes, when they by violence The fattest of Gods offrings from him got, And with foule Lust defil'd the sacred Tents: Had he like Phineas punish't this offence?"
21850,"Our eares then should not haue so tingeled, To heare of Gods great wrath and sore offence, He and his sonnes in one day slaughtered, And all his race from th' Arke for euer banished."
21851,"Zeale made the warlike Dauid to aspire To build an house for Gods owne habitation, And though warres crost his zeale and good desire, Yet made he for it royall preparation, And's Sonne it finisht on his laid foundation, Who gold and siluer vessels in did bring, It making Iudahs Ioy, the admiration Of all the World, the Seat of the great King, Whither the Tribes goe vp, for his true worshipping."
21852,"I may with this example dignifie The noble zeale of our late famous Queene, Who much desired to reedifie Paules Temples ruines, which so fearefull seeme, And make her faire as euer shee was seene: But warres abroad, and broiles within her Land, Most fatall to this pious worke haue beene; So as it still most ruinous doth stand, Expecting helpe from Solomons pacificke hand."
21853,"Zeale like a Torch it owne selfe doth consume, whil'st burning it to others giueth light, And like to sweetest incense and perfume For others Good, spends all her force and might, Oh blessed fire!"
21854,"if kindled aright, It burne with Loue of Heauen, and holy things, Retaining in our hearts, both day and night, His sweet imbraces, who is King of Kings, Loathing the worlds vaine wanton wicked dallyings."
21855,"This Cupid be thy soules and hearts delight, Whose Bow and golden shafts of Zeale and Loue, Doe conquer Fury's, Fates, and worlds despight, And stay the thunderbolts of angry Ioue: Oh see the force of Loue and Zeale doth moue All powers that in Heau'n, Earth, Hell transcend; Grant thee alone I zealously may Loue; And let thy Iealousie me safe defend, That neuer to strange Gods I my affection bend."
21856,"Let vs learne zeale of him that in the day's Of's slesh, did offer Prayers, supplication With strongest cry's and teares to God alwayes, That able was to saue him from his Passion; And learne of him true holy indignation, To be ev'n eaten vp with feruent zeale, To see theeues den, in Gods owne habitation, But first let Knowledge our Commission seale That where this Feruour wounds, our Charitie may heale."
21857,"But ah our zeale of Prayer now growes cold, Zeale of Gods glory like our Charitie, And as the world declines, now waxing old, Ev'n so doth all our zeale and pietie: We raise our houses ev'n to dare the skie, But raze Gods Temples equall with the ground, Our Fathers built them for posteritie, And left with Ornaments adorned round, But we them with their Ornaments seeke to confound."
21858,"As for the Temples of the Holy Ghost, I meane our hearts the Bridegroomes habitation, We will bestow on them no spirituall cost, But leaue them foil'd with vilest prophanation; Pride, Lust, Vaine-glory, all abomination, Tis time to wish this holy Bishops zeale Would make of them to God new consecration, And that the Holy Ghost their doores would seale, Against all spirituall theeues, that holy goods would steale."
21859,"Oh that some holy fit of Heau'nly fire, Raising my Muse to zealous contemplation, Would in mine heart that feruent flame inspire, And zealous Loue Saint Paul bare to his nation, When, as hee could haue wish't eu'n reprobation For their sakes, from whose flesh Christ did descend; Or of the Prophet, by predestination Most sure, his name in Booke of Life was pen'd Yet wisht it wiped out Gods glory to defend."
21860,"But I confesse, we rather doe enuy, Gods gifts and graces in our Bretheren, And Iosuah-like forbid them prophesie, Shewing more zeale to honour Greatnesse, then To Glorifie the King of Heau'n, yea when We in our hearts find any emulation, 'Tis for vaine-glory, and the praise of men, To build our houses, not Gods habitation, And leaue faire large possessions to our generation."
21861,"Let vs with Dauid make a sacred vow, And to th'Almightie God of Iacob sweare Neuer to come within our house, nor bow Our Limbs vpon our Beds, till we prepare A place Gods spirituall Temple vp to reare: Nor euer suffer sleepe within our eyes, Or slumber in our eye-lids to appeare, Till we an habitation doe deuise, Where we may to th'Almightie offer sacrifice."
21862,"My mind inflame Lord with that hot desire And zeale to glorifie thy holy name, That like thy Martyrs I may dread no fire, Because I feele within a hotter flame."
21863,"Hot Coles therefore shall be to mee the same, As to the Martyr was the Boiling Oyle, Which did more coole indeed than him inflame, Because his zeale within did hotter boile, Sweet heau'nly dewes doe most inrich the hottest soile."
21864,"Oh were mine head a conduit full of teares, Mine eyes two rocks continually to run, As well to cleanse foule Lusts of youthfull yeeres, As coole the zealous slames in me begun; Had I thus once my Bridegroomes presence won, I neuer would let goe my well-laid hold, Till hee into my Mothers chamber come, With sweet embraces ay, mee to infold, His ardent Loue would neuer let my zeale grow cold."
21865,"MY Muse now fares like to some Pilot wise, Who hauing some dread stormes of danger past, That tost his vessell oft vp to the skies, Now sailing in the calme with temperate blast, Goes gently on, lest too much dangerous hast His ship vnwares on hidden rocke impight, And him and all his hopes away should cast, For thus it oft befalls some carelesse wight, To wreck in fairest calme, when they the storme haue quight."
21866,"I late was tost in rough and boisterous Sea, Of Zeale and Iealousie, which hauing past, I am to saile in calme and fairest Lea, Of Temperance, most abstinent and chast; Therefore my Muse goes on with sober hast, Knowing against her many dangers lie, Which by the touch, tongue, smell, eye, eare, or taste, Would her entrap, and bring in ieopardy, Which Poets by the Syr'ts and Syrens doe imply."
21867,"And therefore did the famous blind Bards quill, Preferre Vlysses in his Court of Fame, Who of this Temperance had got the skill, Fore Aiax, Hector, or Achilles name, His Odysses may testifie the same Which were compos'd his Temperance to commend By which he men and monsters ouercame, And did life, honour, chastitie defend, 'Gainst Syrens and Enchantments to his latest end."
21868,"And sure the Heathen, to all Christians shame, Seem'd wondrously vs herein to transcend, But that they wanted that most holy flame Of zeale, which I so lately did commend, And knowledge, which should guide them to their end, All that they had by natures light was showne, But God his holy Word to vs doth send, Whereby his Will and Counsell is made knowne, What fruit then ought we beare, where so good seed is sowne."
21869,"Eue was the first Author of Intemperance, Led by her eye, nice tast, and fond desire Of Knowledge, with proud wicked Ignorance, And chang'd Gods Loue to euerlasting ire, The Garden loosing for eternall fire; But what shee lost his Temperance doth gaine, Whose aid now in mine entrance I desire Who from all food, did fortie dayes abstaine, And all's Life from intemperate, thought, word, deed, refraine."
21870,"This Vertue some doe make so Cardinall, That all the rest, in her they would imply, As    Honesty, Purenesse, all true moderation, Which doth withhold from Sin and Vanitie, And bringeth vnto true humiliation: Most happy Mother of so faire a Generation."
21871,"But in some limits that I may her bound, I her define to be a moderation Of such desires, as are within vs found In Diet, Actions, Words, and Affectation; For with these fow'r I bound my Meditation; In Diet shee requires Sobrietie, In Actions, true vnfain'd humiliation, Her Words she graceth aye with Modesty, And her affections charmes with Meeknesse; Chastity."
21872,"See in her Diet, first Sobrietie, In words and actions true humiliation, Accompany'd with precious Modesty; Last Continence from Lust, and angry Passion, The cause of all is prudent Moderation; The aged Palmer, Spencer, Guyons trustie guide, That stands against all stubborne perturbation, By whose sage helpe, secure and safe we slide, By whirle-pooles, and deepe gulfes which gape for vs so wide."
21873,"For all through this worlds boistrous Sea must passe, Before we at our quiet Hav'n arriue, The Boate our Body is, as brittle glasse, Our Steeres-man▪ Temperance, it right doth driue, Besides the Rocks, that threat this Boat to riue; Are many Gulphes, and Whirle-pooles of decay Which wait th' Affections, and the Senses fiue By force and sweet Allurements to assay, Some fall by rage and diet, some by lustfull play."
21874,"But in that Body where doth reason sway, And Sense and Passion be obedient, There the affections all behold you may In happy peace, and goodly gouernment: There Temperance adornes her glorious Tent, With vertues all to make it shine most bright, The mirrour of Gods workes most excellent, And to them all such bounteous banquets dight, As may be best for Health, Praise, Profit, and Delight."
21875,Most glorious frame of nature!
21876,"which shee built, The whole world in one point t'epitomize, Iust, pure, and perfect, till intemprate guilt, Her Makers Hests by Pride did foule misprise, Since that shee learned to belowly, wise, And not obey intemperate desire, Thus shee her glorious house reedifies, And most of all doth lowly Cells admire, The loftiest is no place for temperate retire."
21877,"Shee therefore neuer comes in company, Of such as swim in pride, and bathe in blisse, Wasting their dayes in ease and luxury, For in such ease, men easily doe amisse, But hee whose mind in studie watchfull is, Whose limbs are toyl'd with labour, mind, with paine; Shee these as her sweet darlings deare doth kisse, The idle life cannot to her attaine; Before her Gate, high God employment did ordaine!"
21878,"Excesse doth make the minde of beastly man, Forget his first created excellence; That pure estate in which his Life began, And as a Beast that wants intelligence, 'Twixt sense and reason put no difference, But like a Brute of base and swinish kind; Delights in filth and foule incontinence, For Lust and Wine so far transforme the minde, Affections beare the sway, and royall reason binde."
21879,"Thus Bacchus Fountain's turn'd to puddle lake, Wherein like filthy beasts base men lie drown'd, And Swines of Gods faire Images doe make; This vice hath now with vs such footing found, As Drunkennesse with glory doth abound, Pure Liber, wont to be the Muses friend, All musing, Wit and Learning doth confound, The Flemings this did first to vs commend, But herein we them and all Nations now transcend."
21880,"No better stratageme doth Satan know, (I alwayes must except base drunkennesse) Then gaming all our youth to ouerthrow, The fruict Intemperate of Idlenesse Oh horrible, infernall wickednesse: To heare a wretch, his Makers name blaspheme, When Dice or Carding crosse his good successe, And eu'n his Soule, which Christ's bloud did redeeme; With his estate, to hazard to a dyes esteeme."
21881,"Intemprate, drinking, Play, smoake, in excesse Is now our gallants onely occupation, The poisoning fruits of their loose Idlenesse, Base Gourmandizing, filthy Fornication Is turn'd from foule reproach to commendation, Now vse of Armes and manly exercise, Are held a toile and not a recreation; Who so is moderate, chast, valiant, wise, Him as precise and cynicall they doe despise."
21882,"learne Temperance of thy Dog, Thine Horse and Hawke, wherein thou tak'st delight, Which when they should shew sport, thou dost not clog And fill with food, their greedie appetite; Thou them dost diet, that they may be light, And keepst from Lust, their courage to prolong, One dulls the Body, th'other kills the Sprite, But Abstinence doth make both swift and strong, The temperate mans dayes are happy healthfull long."
21883,"And may vnto Pauls Pilote be compar'd, Whose vessell with exceeding tempest tost, Vnlades, and lightens, hauing most regard, To saue his Life, though all his goods be lost; Eu'n so the temperate man in this world crost, With baits of appetite, lust, anger, pride, Makes vse of those that for his vse are most, But needlesse things, wherewith his vessels cloid, With his owne hands doth to the hungry, fish diuide."
21884,"When I behold the stately Firmament, Adorn'd with glorious Lamps of heau'nly fire; The Stars with their appointed roomes content, And neither other to supplant desire; Their Temperance in Heau'n, I doe admire: But then I view the anbitious sparkes below, Who to possesse the whole Earth doe aspire; And all poore Cottages to ouerthrow, That stopt their prospect, great alone on earth to grow."
21885,"Nature with small, no plentie Lust can bound, Vnlimited desires here satisfie, No Gold, nor Siluer can, though they abound, Like stones amongst the wise Kings vanitie: Though Iesses Sonne haue such varietie Of Wiues and Maids, yet comes the stranger, Lust, Vrias onely Lamb for him must dye, No home-bred fare, can satisfie base dust; But strange rare cates from forraine nations haue we must."
21886,"The temprate man, I to a Brooke compare, Contented with sweet Fountaines of her owne; Which runs most pleasant, pure, delightfull, cleere: But if with flouds her channels once be flowne, Then streight her troubled waters foule are growne."
21887,"So whil'st we Temperance with vs retaine, And no excesse of Diet's in vs knowne, Our heart from ire, our bed is free from staine: But cease from Temperance, and all is foule againe."
21888,"And as pure Streames continue sweet and cleere, Whil'st they within their Channells swiftly flow, Refreshing all the plants and flowers neere, But if they idlely stand, or run but slow, Then thicke and foule like idle lake they grow: Ev'n so the man that doth his minde aduance, His Makers heau'nly will to doe and know, To honour shall be rais'd aboue all chance, But he that idle grow's falls to Intemperance."
21889,"Shee is a short, but a most pleasant way, Wherein small labour is but much delight, The Empresse that doth our affections sway, The Genus of all other vertues hight, Piller of Fortitude, The Helmet bright, Against Lasciuiousnesse, The eyes best guide, Bond of goodwill, of cogitations light, Restraint; The Enemy of Lust and Pride, The Soules chast counsellour, her vow' and prayers to guide."
21890,"Of Prudence and true Wisdome the foundation, To him that hath her, can no ill befall, No greater wealth can be then Contentation, Who hath her, hath that, who lacks that, wants all, Who nothing need; eu'n Gods the Heathen call."
21891,"Fortune may bring vs wealth and royall fare, But Temperance must giue content withall, By her we freed from perturbations are, And hauing daily bread, doe take no farther care: For from her Temper shee receiues her name, As being of extreames the moderation, The golden meane that doth affections frame, Actions and Words to natures ordination, Vnspotted pure as at our first Creation: Thus wee abstaine from Lust and Violence, And though on earth is yet our Conuersation, Wee hope ere long to be receiued hence, Meane while, our Life's a sacrifice of Continence."
21892,"Thus see our protoplasts first cloth'd in skins The greene herbe of the field their onely meate, The Beasts their Conuiues, and the Woods their Inns, To shield from cold, and saue from scorching heate, And all this must be got with toile and sweate, No liuing thing was then allowed good; For, as the learned thinke, man might not eate, Of any liuing creature till the Floud, But since, as the greene herbe, God gaue them all for food."
21893,"How often did the Fathers pray and fast, And some from women, some from wine abstaine, Till sixtie yeeres they keepe their bodies chast, A Temprate and chast seed here to obtaine: When Ruth at Booz feet, all night had laine He ladeth her with corne and sends away, From lawlesse Lust he doth himselfe containe, Though he had dranke, and cheer'd his heart that day, An habite of true Temperance see here you may."
21894,"Ioseph would not against his Maker sinne, For Pharoahs Stewards Ladies soft embrace, Yet easier 'tis a walled towne to winne, Than to resist temptations vile and base, Nought sooner doth our liues with Lust disgrace, Than bathe in ease and swim in foule excesse, Had Dauid beene at warre in Ioabs place He had not falne into such wickednesse, Adultery, the fruit of fulnesse, Idlenesse."
21895,"Oh tell me Dauid, where was then become, Thy fasting wont thy soule to humble so, That it was wont to thy reproach to come, And weakned so thy knees, thou couldst not goe?"
21896,"Thy teares which did to such great plentie grow, They were thy meat and drinke, both day and night, All watering thy couch, so they did slow, That eu'n my Muse weepes at thy piteous plight, Yet had thy soule therein vnspeakeable delight."
21897,"I cannot but admire the Temperance, Of that great Monarch; mightie Phillips Sonne, Who when he had vnto his gouernance, Darius Empire, Wife and Daughters wonne, Their beautie would by no meanes looke vpon; Esteeming it a most vnworthy deed, When he so many men had ouercome, To be of one weake woman conquered, Like Temperance of so yong a Prince I neuer read."
21898,"Not that the Heathens Temper I compare, To those that haue beene truely sanctifide, Of which Iob is to vs a patterne rare; Who least his eyes should draw his heart aside, Did couenant they on no Maid should glide: How infinite are watchings, fastings, cold, Which to subdue the flesh Paul did abide, But aboue all th'examples I haue told, The Locust-eater and's Disciples liues behold."
21899,"And though whilst that the Bridegroome pleas'd to stay, The children of Bride-chamber did not fast, Yet when from them he taken was away, Behold they then did pay for all was past, And oft did hunger, whip, and prison tast; No Poets quill ere able was to faine, Like Temp'rance of pure Lamb most temprate chast, Reuiled, scoffed, scorned, scourged, slaine; Yet opn'd not his mouth to scoffe, or speake againe."
21900,"Oh shall the King of Angels and of Men, Abus'd by workmanship of his owne hand, Endure such wrongs, and neuer turne agen: Whose one word could haue call'd th'whole heau'nly Band, The Fury of these wretches to withstand; And shall the Lord of Life so meekly dye, For our intemperate affections; and Shall not we them all with him crucifie, And fleshly members of our Body's mortifie?"
21901,"But we like Foxes build a stately hall, And like the Birds in stately cedars nest, When Hee that did of nothing make them all, Had not a place to lay his head to rest; Wee see his glorious members here distrest, Want lodging, food, and raiment for the cold, Whil'st we abound in meates, and fill our chest With change of raiment, and with store of gold, And in birds softest plumes, our looser limbs infold."
21902,"Alas how many hunting worlds gay showes, By base Intemperances sweetned baite, And vile Ambition which downe headlong throwes, Are brought to ruine most infortunate; Oh grant that I may liue in meane estate, And my freed soule with Contemplation please; My clothing warme, my diet temperate, Freed from all tempests of worlds raging seas, Which tosse poore sailing soules, in dangerous disease."
21903,"Most happy who with little is content, That though he want, yet neuer doth complaine; Ne wisheth more his sorrow to augment, Knowing that he by heaping wealth doth gaine, Nothing but care, vexation, and paine: What more than daily bread here doe I need?"
21904,What need of forraine cates or feathers vaine?
21905,"Let fields my food; my flocke my clothing breed, No other would I weare, no other would I feed."
21906,"In vaine doe foolish men the Heau'ns accuse Of sad misfortunes, paines, and iniuries, Which doe (if we knew truely them to vse) To eu'ry man what's fittest for him size, That's not the best estate which most we prize, Nor that the worst, which most men seeke to shun, Each as he list his fortunes may deuise, Which wishes, no man happinesse hath wun, Such wishers cease to liue, before their life begun."
21907,"It is mans mind that maketh good or ill, Wretched or happy, sad, glad, rich or poore, He hath abundantly all things at will, That hauing little, yet desires no more, When he that's drown'd in wealth, & swims in store, Doth liue in want to satisfie desire, Which neuer hath enough, fond fooles therefore, Are they that feed Lusts and Ambitions fire, Which like base Auarice, doth more and more require."
21908,"When first I saw the glory of the Great, I then them onely happy men did hold, For sumptuous houses, lodging, rayment, meat, Honour, Attendance, Iewells, Siluer, Gold, But when the cares and dangers I behold, Of those whom Fortune doth so high aduance, How to dissembling slattery some are sold; Lust, Fulnesse, Idlenesse, Intemperance; My life I happy deeme, in quiet lowly chance."
21909,"Thus of late folly's, I though late complaine, And that sweet Peace, which doth not there appeare, Now in mine homely Cell I entertaine, Which by her want I learne to loue more deare; Sweet holy quiet life!"
21910,"where meanest cheare To hungry stomocks, is a daily feast, Where thirst like Nectar, makes fresh cooling beere; Where in a cabbin is more quiet rest, Than on Downe Persian beds, with Gold and Feathers drest."
21911,"In this estate I no man doe enuie, Nor would enuied be of any one; Great store of wealth, doth store of cares supply, That little that I haue is still mine owne, I reape with Ioy the crop, that I haue sowne, Without least care but onely to attend it, The Lambs I weane, are daily greater growne: What haue I but to praise him that doth send it?"
21912,And with a cheerefull heart vnto the poore to lend it.
21913,"But least corrupt my mind, or body grow with too much ease, or wanton Idlenesse; My mind I set my Makers Will to know, His Wisedome, Power, Truth, and Holinesse; I often ride or walke to wearinesse, The members of my body to subdue And Temper 'gainst Lust and Laciuiousnesse, Thus by sweet contemplation, oft I view, Such high transcendent things, as yet I neuer knew."
21914,"Thus rapt with contemplation I find, That all these worlds-gay show's which men admire, Are but vaine shadow's, to the ioy's of mind Of those, that lead their liues in safe retire; Whose onely happinesse and hearts desire, Is here the talents God hath lent to spend Vnto his glory, as he doth require, And vsing Temperately what he doth send; Thus grant that I may liue, Thus grant that I may end."
21915,"NOw will I raise faire Alma's stately tower, On Temperance, her strong and soundest frame; And goodly deck Dame Bounty's dainty bower, Whereby all Princes gaine immortall fame: Some call her Alma, some her Bounty name, The trusty Almner of Loues Royall Court; Who beares the bag to giue to blind and lame, And Suitors all that thither doe resort Rewards most bounteously, and feeds in seemely sort."
21916,"For on this heau'nly Dame the eyes of all Looke vp, that of her liberalitie They may receiue, and shee againe lets fall, Vpon them needfull things most plenteously, Her bounteous hand shee opens willingly, With blessings eu'ry creature full to fill, To those that Knowledge seeke, abundantly, Shee giueth Wisdome, Vnderstanding, Skill, To know their Makers Bountie, Maiestie, and Will."
21917,Most glorious Alma!
21918,"when as Temperance Controlls the noble Plentie of her Hall, And with her Staffe keepes out Intemperance, Which doth abuse her Grace and Bountie all; For where most Plentie is, there most doe fall By want of Temperance to Lust and Sin, Till they be brought low as the Prodigall, For he that will true Praise by Bountie win, Must first of all at home with Temperance begin."
21919,"For Temperance with watchfull diligence, Are like two springs which waters doe supply, To open handed free Beneficence, And her discernes from Prodigalitie, By Diligence we get sufficiencie By Temperance, what we haue gotten, spare To minister to Liberalitie, For these two, Lady-Bounty's handmaids are, And for her, iust, and truly, store of wealth prepare."
21920,"But they that liue in sloth and foule excesse, Though they may seeme to be most liberall, Oppression, and Extortion mercilesse, Are Lakes, from whence their Bounty's streamed doe fall, And thus they rob the poore, that therewithall They may themselues, rich friends, and children feast, Blaspheming their great Maker, Lord of all, And imitating basest sauage beast, Which fawnes vpon the great, But doth deuoure the least."
21921,"Who to thy vassall Man at his Creation, Didst subiect make, Fish, Fowle, Beasts, creatures all, And of thine handy works gau'st domination; Who by thy prouidence and ordination Him needfull things not onely dost prouide, But for his health, delight and contentation, That he may plentie to the poore diuide, My Muse to sing, heart, hands, to practise Bountie guide."
21922,"Bountie, Beneficence, Benignitie, In name though diuers, one in substance be, Beneuolence and Liberalitie, Make actions, and affections agree, If as they are, in God you wish to see, They like his Goodnesse are vnlimitted, And as his Mercy, Loue, and Grace are free, Which on his creatures are abundant shed, But by my shallow Muse their depth cannot be read."
21923,"They are too high to reach, too deepe to sound, For all the earth is filled therewithall: In heau'n aboue Gods Goodnesse doth abound, The Bountie of his Grace is ouer all; Of all the Meditations which call My mind, to holy Ioy and admiration, None lets more comfort than Gods Bountie fall, Both for my being and my preseruation, But most in that he shed his bloud for my Saluation."
21924,"Here could I wish my Muse might euer dwell, In viewing Gods great Goodnesse, Bountie, Loue, Which three to th'holy Trinitie I well May here ascribe; For Goodnesse first doth moue The Father, to beget Eternall Loue, From Loue and Goodnesse, Bountie doth proceed: Yet all these three, as one in God doe proue, In substance one, although distinguished In working!"
21925,But this height my reach doth far exceed.
21926,"And therefore rauish't now with contemplation, Beyond the compasse of my feeble eye, My soule amaz'd falls downe to adoration Of this misterious holy Trinitie, And from diuine come to benignitie: And bountie which should be in men below, A habit wee of liberalitie; Her call and good affection we should show In thought, heart, word, and deed, to eu'ry one we know."
21927,"And must from goodnesse and true loue proceed, The onely cause of true benignitie; Wherefore, except these be in vs indeed, Our bounty is but prodigalitie: Or some like froth of superfluitie."
21928,"The crums and leauings of Intemperance, Which oft are dealt out with an euill eye, More for vaine credit, or base circumstance, Then for goodwill, or care Gods glory to aduance."
21929,"For eu'ry act hath then her true effect, Which from true ground right aymeth at her end, As when both loue and goodnesse doth direct What bounty truly gets, aright to spend: Loe thus doth heau'nly grace and Bounty send Her blessings temporall alike to all; But doth for greater benefits intend, To those that on Gods name aright doe call, And in this heau'nly sort, ought we be liberall."
21930,"then th' effects of bounty glorious are, When Prouidence with true Frugality, Doe seeke by Iustice to prouide and spare Fit sustenance for liberality; Behold that heau'nly bounteous Maiesty, Sends raine and fruitfull seasons whereby store Of Blessings, th'earth may to his hand supply, And many hidden treasures vp doth store For to exalt the rich, and to refresh the pore."
21931,"Then humane bounty like her Makers is, When as shee labours to doe good to all; But most of all to bring poore soules to blisse, And fill their hearts with food spirituall: Oh Grace Diuine?"
21932,"Bounty Angelicall; With spirituall loaues in Wildernesse to feed Gods Saints, when spirituall hunger them doth gal; The ignorant which pine with inward need, Diuine sweet comforts to their fainting soules to reade."
21933,"True Bounty's knowne, best by her company, For shee in Truth and Mercy takes delight;  And is withall Loues graces richly dight, Herein appeares her glorious heau'nly Sp'rite: Shewing that shee of seed diuine is borne, Of Loue and Goodnesse, not of Vaine delight, Or Fame and Praise of men, when shee doth scorne To seeke feign'd bounteous shewes, her goodnes to adorn."
21934,"For thus th' ambitious man is bountifull, Thus belly-gods in plentie take delight, Deceit with gifts his neighbour seekes to gull, The couetous bribe large to conquer right; From such false Bounty, Truth is banish't quite,  Nor any of Loues Graces in her sight, May suffered be their ensignes to aduance, There dwells  As daughters of the horse-leech, still doe cry, Giue giue: as Graue and Hell be neuer full, So nought the couetous eye can satisfie, But he that's liberall and bountifull Is like full clouds, which doe most plentifull Water the earth, and poure downe store of raine, Yet are not emptie; for the mercifull And liberall shall greater plentie gaine, And he that scattereth shall find increase againe."
21935,"That hand is neuer emptie of reward, Where as goodwill the hearts chest filleth full, And bountie neuer is so much afear'd, Causlesse to giue, As not be bountifull Where need requires; His face is beautifull Where sweet Goodwill both heart and lookes haue Ioyn'd; But th'enuious and malitious doe pull, On wrinkles: And a man shall euer find, The beautie of the face to alter with the mind."
21936,"Bountie is like vnto the glorious Sun, Which as a Bridegroome doth from chamber glide, And as a Gyant ioy's his course to run From East to West, most swiftly he doth ride, Nothing from's fertile heat it selfe can hide; He doth not looke that one him vp should call: So bountie deales her Graces far and wide, And Blessings without asking sends to all; Expecting not vaine praise, where shee lets graces fall."
21937,"As some faire glorious garment, which we weare Vpon our shoulders, reaching to the ground, Couers all spots, and Naeues that on vs are: So where this noble bounty doth abound, It couereth all faults that can be found, For as Loue couers, so doth Bounty hide A multitude of sins, and doth confound, By her bright Beames, Detraction, Enuy, Pride; Alas these are to weake where Bounty's on our side."
21938,"Shee's like vnto the Lamp of glorious day, Which doth diuide the darknesse from the light, For whereas Bountie doth her beames display, Behold bright day: without them there is night; The King that by his bountie doth inuite, His subiects hearts to Loue and Honour due, Sleepes more secure, than he that doth by might And feare, strong forts and walled townes subdue, And for his guard's encompassed with armed crue."
21939,"Bountie and Benefits are eu'n the Bands, Of Concord, and as fire doth quickly dye, That is not fostered with coles or brands; So dies true Loue with men: Except supply Be made by gifts and liberalitie: Who doth the wandring soule direct aright, Though with him he doth deale most bounteously; Yet doth he but his fellowes candle light, And to another giues, yet loseth selfe no light."
21940,"True bounty seekes high God to imitate, Who to the most vnthankfull is most free, Sol doth his light to Theeues participate And without tempests, Pirates saile on Sea, The Heau'ns of all good things the Authors bee, Faire fortunes to vngratefull fooles doe send, As onely seeking to doe good: so we (Though oft in vaine our bountie we doe spend) To the vnthankfull must, as to the thankfull lend."
21941,"Gods bounty's like to incense and perfume, Cast on an heart inflam'd with holy zeale, Which praises vp, like cloudes of smoake doth sume, And sweetest odours round about doth deale: Man's Bounty is like widowes cruse or meale, Which spent vpon the Prophet growes to more, Like Surgeons skill, which as he more doth heale, Doth grow more cunning than he was before, The diligent and bounteous hand want neuer store.)"
21942,"As many fruits doe faire encrease and grow, Not so much by the nature of the ground, As by the bounty, which from Heau'n doth flow, And temperate aire that is about them found, So all good Arts in noblest wits abound, More by some Princes liberalitie, And high regard they haue of Muses sound, Than their owne nature, strength, and industry, Best friends to Arts are Bounty and Humanity."
21943,"Should I but here recount the names of all, Whom bountifull in holy Writ I find, I of your patience should be prodigall, And my short time for this discourse assign'd, Let me their names vp in a bundle bind; Which if you please to ope as sweetly smell, As Camphires bush: my Muse is now inclin'd, Of some prophane examples here to tell, Which seeme in noble Bounty others to excell."
21944,"Than treasure Cyrus more his friends esteem'd, Whereof he multitudes by bounty won: And Alexander greatest glory deem'd, By bounty neuer to be ouercome; A King of Egypt thought it better done, His subiects coffers, than his owne to fill: When as Alphonsus heard Titus Vespasians sonne, Accounted that day lost, when for goodwill He had giu'n nought; said, I ne're spent a day so ill."
21945,"these fiue examples liue in one, The bounteous Monarch, that our Scepter sways, Esteemes his friends' boue gold, or precious stone, And ouercomes eu'n all that him obay's, By soueraigne Bounty, to's immortall praise, No King so fills his subiects chests with gold, His bounteous deeds in number passe his day's: Ah!"
21946,"how then dare my niggard rimes be bold, The sacred bounty of my Soueraigne to vnfold."
21947,"Who hoards not vp his wealth in Caue or Tower, Nor into prisons darke condemnes his gold: But as on him from heau'n all Blessings shower, So are his to vs Subiects manifold: As from thicke clouds, we numberlesse behold, Large streames of fruitfull raine on earth to fall: So is his largesse to his seruants told, Who entring poore, returne rich from his hall, Like Tagus golden sands, his hands are liberall."
21948,"Vouchsafe, oh bounteous Soueraigne!"
21949,"heare thy thrall, After thy cloud, a subiects drop'd to sing; Whom thou didst to deserued honour call, And was in name and bountie as a King: Who in thy bounteous steps thee following, Did from obscurity my Fortunes raise, Without desert or my least offering, He now in Heau'n his bounteous King doth praise, As he with bounty honour'd him here all his day's."
21950,"And let vs all his bounteous praises sing, Whose bounty vs from Hell and Death doth raise, Our blessed Sauiour, Prophet, Priest, and King, Who here in bounteous deeds spent all his day's; Casting out Deuills, sauing soules alway's, Healing the sicke, giuing the blind their sight; Mournes for our sins, for enemies he pray's; Comforts the rich, and feeds the hungry wight, And still in doing good, doth set his whole delight."
21951,"How could malicious heart of enuious man, Consent to murther such a bounteous King?"
21952,"Scourge, scorne, deride, despight him what they can, Still in his bounteous deeds perseuering; Yea when vnto the Crosse they him doe bring, Father they know not what they doe, he cry's; And when his body hangs their torturing, He to the Thiefe not Paradise denyes; Thus doing good he liues: Thus doing good he dyes."
21953,What doth the Lord of Life eternall dye?
21954,"Which vnto vs eternall life doth giue; See his large bounty, and benignity?"
21955,"Hee gaue his life for vs, that we might liue, What heart of stone doth not here melt, or riue But with his Life, his Bounty doth not end, He by his Will, and Testament doth giue Vs Heau'n, yea more the Comforter doth send, With millions of Angells, on vs to attend."
21956,Who can of this his Sauiours Bountie tast?
21957,"And to his members not be bountifull, If thou want wealth, and coine giue what thou hast, And let our hearts be alwaies mercifull, And like the fertile ground yeeld plentifull Encrease, of all the seeds which thereon grow, 'Tis Bountie that doth fill our garner's full, He sparing reapes, that sparingly doth sowe, True Bounty's noble hand no want did euer know."
21958,"But ah too many couetous of Praise And Glory doe by fraud and rapine spoile; Other's, that they thereby there names may raise, And some goods gotten by much care and toile, Spend on their pleasures, and thereby beguile, Their poore and needy neighbour of his right, Drinking and surfetting in ease the while, And spending frankly on some base delight, Like Brutes are bountifull to their owne appetite."
21959,"Some onely by their Bountie seeke for fame, And these are onely to Ambition free, Some Patrons now aday's such Shepheards name, To feed the Flocke, as loose and Idle Bee, Wealth vnto wealth to adde they all agree: Mo man respects the needy and the poore, The emptie vessels, emptie still we see; They that are full, to them is added more, Dry hills want water, when the valley's swim with store."
21960,"As Knights which of the noble Order are Of Garter, that they better may be knowne, A golden George about their necke they weare, Nor doe the same at any time lay downe, Whereby their noblenesse should be vnknowne: So Nobles alwaies weare Benignitie, Whereby whose Sonnes you are yee may be showne, For nothing proues you Sonnes of the most High, More than your Bountie and true Liberalitie."
21961,"But of salse bountie you doe vainely boast, Delighting in vaine pastime, oyle and Wine, And gluttons feed for glory to your cost, Whil'st at your doores, the poore may sterue and pine, You welcome such as you inuite to dine; But scarce afford the poore scraps, at your gate; Which shew that all your bountie is to Ioyne Credit and Glory to your great estate, And but for Crowes and Kites, or Daw's do lay a Baite."
21962,"You for a million at a cast will play, And hazard all your fortunes at a game, And grudge not for one daintie bit to pay A thousand, and then glory in the same, With gold you tricke and trim vp some loose Dame, The sinke that sucks vp all your Liberalitie, Thus lauish you to your eternall shame, All that your Fathers got by their Frugalitie, And left to you to spend in bounteous hospitalitie."
21963,"Braue Alexanders deeds for ay commends His wondrous confidence, and bountie rare; Who dealing out amongst his faithfull friends, Lands, houses, townes, he gold and all did share, When one besought him wisely to forbeare, For what, said he, alas!"
21964,is left the King?
21965,"New hopes of gaming more, said he, there are, Thus on his fate and fortunes venturing The Heau'ns propitious seem'd, to him, in eu'ry thing."
21966,"thy hopes are all but vaine, As were the Benefits thou didst expose; But we are certaine of eternall gaine, If bounteously Gods blessings we dispose: Ah!"
21967,what is it if worldly things we loose!
21968,"And thereby gaine vs an Eternall Crowne, Which heau'nly Bountie layeth vp for those, That their owne glory willingly lay downe, And what they reape by Bountie bounteously haue sowne."
21969,"Such all within most gloriously shall shine, Their vestiments shall be of twined Gold; They shall of Hony tast, and spiced Wine; And all the Bridegroomes fruits both new and old, He gently will such in his armes infold; And satisfie their sense with pleasing smell, No eare hath heard, no tongue hath euer told, The Ioy and Bounty that with him doe dwell, But more of these, where next of heau'nly Ioy I tell."
21970,V. Of Spirituall and Heau'nly IOY.
21971,"HOw should a heart opprest with worldly cares, Of Spirituall inward Ioy now rightly sing; Since none her knowes, but who her image beares, And feeles the Spirits inward witnessing: All sacred stuffe I to this building bring No helpe, but he that Abba Father cry's, Can teach my Muse to touch this golden string, I therefore here forbeare prophane supply's, My Spirit wholly on the holy Spirit rely's."
21972,"Well, said the King, All worldly things are vaine, And trauell which beneath the Sun he found Compared to left drop or minutes gaine, Which Spirituall Ioy did to his heart propound; No reach of Wisards skill, no wit profound, Is able this true Ioy to comprehend, This Musicke wholly to the Saints doth sound, The inward man can onely apprehend, Sweet liuely Spirituall Ioy, which neuer shall haue end."
21973,"No Muses darling euer yet did dreame, Of this sweet wind, which where it lists doth blow; This onely is sweet Israels Singers theame, Which he by heau'nly influence did show; And then most, when the outward man brought low, By paine of body, or by griefe of mind, Did from his pen diuinest comforts flow, Most heau'nly Ioy's, which he was wont to find, To grow more strong within, as he without declind."
21974,Oh Ioy of ioy's?
21975,"vnspeakeable delight, Eu'n when our soules the powers of hell doe shake, And vs with Iustice and due vengeance fright, When as our guilty conscience is awake, That all with terrour tremble, horrour quake; That then our gentle beame of heau'nly Grace, Not onely shall from vs this horrour take, But in Loues armes vs in an instant place, They onely know this Ioy, that haue beene in this case."
21976,"If euer I receiued strength and skill From Heau'n, to scale the hill of contemplation, I now doe hope Gods gracious Spirit will, Me fill with Ioy for his sweet meditation; Oh, blessed Spirit!"
21977,"who by sweet inspiration, Directest eu'ry holy Prophets quill, Enlighten mine, by heau'ns illumination, That most diuine sweet Ioy's it may distill Into the Readers heart, and Mine with comfort fill."
21978,"No tongue could euer tell, no heart conceiue, Therefore no Art is able to define What is the inward Ioy which we receiue, By peace of conscience, and Grace diuine: But sure it is, that speciall marke or signe, Which on our soules the holy Spirit of Grace Most gently doth imprint, and liuely line, Whereby we doe behold Gods cheerefull face, And spiritually feele, our Bridegroomes sweet embrace."
21979,"There is a naturall and carnall Ioy, Besides this inward Ioy spirituall, By one we common blessings here enioy, By th'other we in Sin and errour fall; Those be partakers of Ioy naturall, That health of body haue, and worldly store, The carnall Ioy we sinfull pleasures call, Excesse of meate, and wine, Lips of a whore, And all mans vaine delights 'gainst rule of heau'n lore."
21980,"These Ioy's, which with false pleasures vs deceiue, Are not of kin to Ioy spirituall; For that they alway's doe our hearts bereaue Of inward Ioyes pure food Angelicall; Gods goodnesse is th'efficient cause of all, And though each person in the Trinitie, May seeme to haue a working seuerall, Yet all in one, and one in all agree, With Ioy here to begin mans true felicitee."
21981,"There many causes are materiall, Why we this inward Ioy in vs should haue▪ Gods freest grace, which doth most surely call, All those that he elected hath to saue; The Peace of conscience, which Ioy vs gaue, And eke the Ioy of our Sanctification: Whereby eu'n heauens inheritance we craue, And certainly expect glorification, And are inuited guests to heau'ns participation."
21982,"As are Gods gifts and graces infinite, So causes are of Ioy spirituall; It fills my soule with infinite delight, When all his benefits to mind I call; But none like this that's Sonne should saue vs all; By that great secret of his Incarnation, Which made the Babe into Ioy's passion fall, At blessed Mothers heau'nly Salutation, And made blind Simeons soule, reioyce in his Saluation."
21983,"This made the Mother of the Babe to sing, And her sweet little Lord to magnifie Her Sauiour, which shee in her armes did bring; This made in heau'nly Host such melody, When newes was brought of his Natiuity; Oh Ioy of Ioy's!"
21984,"to you is borne this day A Sauiour, God from all eternitie: This made the Wise-men from the East to stray, And offer to him gifts, that in a cradle lay."
21985,"This made the holy King, propheticall, Though many pleasant Lay's to Harpe hee sing, Straine none so high, and so patheticall, As those of his Sonne, Sauiour, Lord, and King: Oh then each stroake, hee strikes, to heau'n doth ring."
21986,"His heart reioyceth; and his tongue is glad, Such Ioy doth hope of resurrection bring, That though his flesh be with corruption clad, His heart shall neuer faint, nor soule be euer sad."
21987,"We for this hope, it count exceeding Ioy When we doe fall, on many sore temptations, And when afflictions most abound, we Ioy In Trialls, Sufferings, and Tribulations: The Angells in their holy habitations, At our conuersions wondrous Ioy receiue, What passing Ioy will be and delectations, When all the members to their head shall cleaue, And for short Sorrowes, endlesse recompence receiue."
21988,"My Muse her selfe eu'n out of breath now fly's, Rais'd vp so high by Ioy Spirituall; Yet by Ioy's obiects, she must higher rise, To Father, Sonne, the Holy Ghost, and all: What greater Ioy, than on the Father call; And how did Abraham reioyce to see?"
21989,The day of his Redeemers nuptiall; Ah what more Ioy vnspeakeable can bee?
21990,Than feele the holy Spirit of Grace to dwell in thee.
21991,"Oh happy Host, such guests to entertaine, With peace of conscience, their continuall feast, Open you euerlasting doores againe, Open, The King stands knocking ready prest; The King of Glory, to come in and rest: Downe from the fig-tree speedily then come, And entertaine thy Sauiour in thy brest, To day Saluation is to thee come home, With Faith, Hope, Loue, and Truth perfume thou eu'ry rom."
21992,"For without these, true Ioy will neuer stay, With her must all the heau'nly Graces bide, Long-suffering, Mercy, Peace, desire to Pray, God these hath ioyn'd, no man may them diuide, False Ioy's without these into vs may slide, As stony ground, which did receiue the seed; Did flourish faire, and Branch on eu'ry side; But this did Faith, but temporary breed, And we this but a momentany Ioy areed."
21993,"There are besides this friendly seeming Ioy, Other that are professed enemy's; As those which worldly happinesse enioy, And liue in pleasures, ease, and jollity's: Against these th'author of true ioy reply's, Woe vnto you that laugh, for you shall waile, Lament and howle for your iniquity's, When Iudgement comes, and all mens hearts shal faile, What then shall all your worldly pleasures you auaile."
21994,"Another Ioy against true Ioy I find, When in true cause of Ioy we so delight, That we omit from Lusts, to clense our mind, And valiantly 'gainst base affections fight, Ah!"
21995,"how can heau'nly true Ioy take delight, Amongst our grosse corruptions here to dwell, Sure this Reioycing is not good and right, A little Leuen makes the whole lump smell, Our boastings vaine: This water's not from liuing well."
21996,"There is a counterfett, and feign'd delight, Shew'd in the face, but comes not from the heart, Whom I may call, A merry Hypocrite, Others reioyce so in their owne desert, In their redemption they will beare a part: These are the men, whom workes must iustifie, Alas!"
21997,"remember what thou art, And whence thou hast receiued thy supply, And thou shalt soone from this thy proud reioycing slye."
21998,Proud slesh and bloud!
21999,"that dares of merits boast, When in thy Makers presence thou do'st stand, And hopest to regaine what Adam lost, By thine inherent Iustice: thou do'st band, Directly 'gainst thy Makers glory; and, Seek'st to reioyce in Iustice of thine owne, Presume not 'boue thy strength to vnderstand, But merry be and glad in God alone, Who is all Worthinesse, but in thy selfe is none."
22000,"As those which vaine applause of men regard, And at their doing almes a trumpet blow; Gaine onely praise of men, for their reward, But God no such good-workes will euer know; So those in whom these boasting merits flow, And in their meritorious workes delight, God neuer them doth this sound comfort show, They may awhile seeme goodly in mans sight, But neuer feele true inward Ioy and sound delight."
22001,"As those which onely see the Stars and Moone, But neuer saw faire Phaebus glorious light, Beleeue no cleerer lights haue euer shone; Than those faire Lamps, which doe adorne the night; So those that neuer knew this true delight, Those heau'nly Ioy's to holy Saints confin'd, Thinke there most Ioy, where flesh doth most delight: But tast they once sweet inward Ioy of mind, In all these worldly Ioy's they no content can find."
22002,"This heau'nly Ioy by no similitude, In Heau'n or Earth can truly be exprest, Yet is shee felt; as oft in simple rude, As in the most profound, deepe learned breast; None know her, till they be of her possest."
22003,"For as we feele the winde when it doth blow, But whence it comes, or where it meanes to rest, No wit of man ere able was to show; So many feele these Ioy's, but know not whence they flow."
22004,"As in the Incarnations mysteries, The blessed Virgin ouer-shadowed By th' Holy Ghost, and power of the most High; Perceiu'd her fruitfull womb replenished, But knew not whence, till th' Angell it aread; So wee this Babe of Ioy spirituall, Oft feele in vs most liuely quickened; But know not how, nor whence the same doth fall, Till that same Spirit of Truth, to vs reuealeth all."
22005,"And as no creature able is of man, The Spirit to discerne, but man alone, So of this Spirituall Ioy, no spirit can Conclude, but this sweet spirituall holy One: Some would it liken to the glorious Sunne, Which by his liuely beames doth Life inspire; Where they an obiect fit to light vpon, But I forbeare too nicely to inquire, And rather in mine heart, to feele her beames desire."
22006,Oh Sunne of Light!
22007,"Bright Glory of thy Sire, Who when thou left'st the earth, thy Spirit didst send, Into our hearts sweet comforts to inspire, And with vs to abide till world's last end: Some good examples to my Muse commend, Of holy men, which tooke so much delight In heau'nly Ioy's, they holy them intend, And banish all vaine worldly pleasures quite Shining like glorious Lamps in worlds obscurest night."
22008,"This inward heate, this holy heau'nly fire, Most what concealed vnder ashes ly's Which one, till into flames they doe respire, At home more easie, than aborad descry's: Because it selfe within best testify's, In Abraham appear'd this holy flame; When as he saw his Sauiour with his eyes Who of his blessed seed long after came, For Abram saw Christs day and ioyed in the same."
22009,"Vp Miriam vp, thou merily canst sing; Now through the Red Sea thou art safely past, Hereby our Baptisme then prefiguring, That when Repentance vs with teares hath wash't, With Ioy wee Egypts Bondage of should cast: But neuer did more Ioyfull musicke sound, Than Dauids: when he of this Ioy did tast, Restore mee to those wonted Ioy's I found, And euer let thy holy Spirit in me abound."
22010,"Oh blessed Bridegroome of the fairest Bride, How often when shee seeketh thee by night, Doest thou thy Ioyfull presence from her hide?"
22011,"That wanting, shee in thee may more delight: How oft againe, when thou do'st her inuite?"
22012,"Rise my belou'd, and ope to mee the doore, Such is her nicenesse, and her sluggish sprite; Shee will not rise to let thee in, before Thou thence art gone; And then thy losse shee doth deplore."
22013,"These are the apples, odours, nuts, and wine, Which comfort her, when shee is sicke of Loue; These Christs embraces that doe her entwine, The kisses which he giues his Turtle Doue: Milke, spice, pomegranats, which shee so doth loue, All these are inward Ioy's the Bride hath here, Whereof she with the Bridegroomes friends doth proue; And eates and drinkes with Ioy and merry cheere, Yea drinkes abundantly with her beloued deare."
22014,"This was the Ioy, that him was set before, That did endure the Crosse, despise the shame, And Lord of all, became low, naked, pore, Enduring death vs to excuse from blame!"
22015,"His Martyrs and Apostles in the same Suffrings and crosses him haue followed; And trode the Wine-presse as their order came, Where some in scorching flames more Ioy's haue red, Than wearied Limbs could find, in softest downy bed."
22016,"This 'twas the Kingly Prophet so admir'd, When loathing all worlds pompe and glory vaine, He this one onely thing of God desir'd, For euer in his Temple to remaine, To view the Beautie of that heau'nly traine: This made him leaue his purple Crowne and Throne, And in a linnen Ephod dance amaine: For this would Constantine be rather one Of Christ his members, then the Empires head alone."
22017,"But why seeke I for witnesses without, Since 'tis the Spirit within that testify's, Our Soule that without wauering or doubt, With  Vnto whose Soule this Spirit eke reply's, Be glad and Ioyfull, I am thy saluation Be not afraid-My Grace shall thee suffice To conquer Hell; And to resist temptation, And yeeld the soundest Ioy in greatest tribulation."
22018,"I will make glad thy soule, delight thine heart, And with a cheerefull countenance will smile, For I am thine and mine againe thou art; And though afflictions here thee square and file, No power in Earth or Hell shall thee beguile Of those sweet Ioy's, which are for thee prepar'd: Oh tarry thou my leasure but a while, And thy petitions all, I will regard, Delight in mee, I am thy hope, and iust reward."
22019,"who can heare these Ioyous inuitations, These blessed promises, and yet complaine, That hee's afraid of crosse, or tribulations: Oh!"
22020,"neuer let these worldly pleasures vaine, Make me so great a looser for their gaine; And let me here all worldly griefes endure, Lord onely free me from eternall paine, This inward Ioy shall euer me assure, And on thy merits I in all, will rest secure."
22021,"Who would not rather couet there to dwell, Where fulnesse is of Ioy for euermore, Than in false vaine delights, which leads to Hell Voluptuous Diet, flatt'rings of a Whore; I rather had with Dauid keepe a dore Where inward Ioy, may in my soule abound; Than swim in pleasures and preferments store, In Princes Courts, where vaine delights are found, Which like faire flowers fade, and quickly fal to ground."
22022,"But I confesse, this prouerb true I find, That where Gods Church is raising, there to build, His Chappell is the Deuill most inclin'd, And where best seed is sowne in Ground well till'd, He with most tares and weeds it alway's fill'd: Vaine pleasures, are his tares, true Ioy's our wheate, Till haruest both together grow in field, Then will the Lord of Haruest surely beat, The cockle from pure corne, at his owne board to eate."
22023,Fountaine of Ioy!
22024,"oh set thy whole delight; Into thy Lawes and Statutes to enquire; To meditate thereon both day and night, My soule than Gold doth more these Ioy's desire."
22025,"Let others honour, wealth, and wine admire; Lift, Lord, on me thy louing countenance, Thy louing fauour, shall my Soule raise higher, Than Princes highest fauours can aduance, To heau'nly spirituall wealth, not subiect vnto chance."
22026,"In holy Writ, I many places find, From whence doe flow these Ioy's spirituall, But no where faster, than within my mind, Oh Lord!"
22027,"Thou know'st; not I; from whence they fall: God of all Peace, and Ioy perpetuall; Let not my Ioy A temporary proue, But with her in mine heart thy Graces all Infuse, Faith, Mercy, Patience, Peace, and Loue; To passe by things below, and seeke for things aboue."
22028,Of endlesse Ioy how should I make an end?
22029,"My Muse is neuer weary of delight; Since I this Meditation did intend, I neuer scarce could sleepe by day or night."
22030,"So doth the pleasing matter me inuite; So full of rimes, and so the numbers run: That I in shorter time haue finish't quite, This tast of Ioy, than I haue earst begun Some other Graces: But my hower-glasse hath done."

22035,"NOt Nature, Order, or Affinity Can Friendships sacred knot so surely tye As choice: For euer there we find the ground Of Loue and Friendship most entirely sound; As their Desires are like, so one there end, Which is to be, and haue a faithfull friend."
22036,"I, that vnto mine owne defects am conscious, Of such an honour durst not be ambitious, Tell thou wert pleas'd to call mee Friend and Brother, (I know not that thou deign'st it any other) Wherefore whil'st Time Life to my Lines shall giue, Our Friendships memory in them shall liue, Who of true Friendship know no other end, Than here to haue and bee A faithfull Friend."

22038,I. Of WISDOME and PRVDENCE.
22039,"THE first degree to Wisdome is the misse Of Folly: For as Darknesse the priuation Is of Lights Being, But no Being is, So Folly is of wise illumination: And as in Chaos rude, at first Creation There was all Darknesse by the want of Light: So in all men before their renouation Are Folly's mists, and errours blackest night, Till there the Spirit moue, which all things doth inlight."
22040,"The Poets which did wondrously transcend In making Mystery's by Fictions plaine, All other Graces as diuine commend, But Wisdome they to be a Goddesse faine; Minerva, who proceedeth from the braine Of Iupiter; whom they the Mistris hight Of all the Graces and the Muses traine, To whom shee oft descends for her delight, Weary'd with toile of Gouernment, and Martiall fight."
22041,"Thus her of Warre, Peace, Politie, and Arts They Goddesse make, as if they should her call The Wisdome God the Father thus imparts Vnto the Sonne, to make rule, order all; With God the Father Coessentiall, As all his Attributes, Power, Truth, and Loue, For on the Persons Consubstantiall No accident can fall or thence remoue, This Soules faint eye conceiues of Wisdome from aboue."
22042,"Which is vnto my minds obscured eye, As to my Body's Sunne in Firmament, The farther off, the easier to descry, For neerenesse breedeth but astonishment, Oh glorious Wisdome, Sun most orient; Into my soule, with Folly clouded shine, Some clearer beames of wisdome excellent, The whil'st I sing these radiant rayes of thine, Which make a mortall wight seeme gloriously diuine."
22043,"What and how great is wisdomes heau'nly skill, No heart of man is able to conceiue, Much lesse expresse by any tongue or quill, For none but Wisdome, wisdome can perceiue: The cause vnknowne of nothing shee doth leaue, A Numen of such wondrous excellence, Shee doth no good but from her selfe receiue; Being her owne end, ayme, and recompence, No good in Heau'n or Earth, but flow's from Sapience."
22044,"And therefore call'd the proper Good of Ioue, Which though to Men and Angells hee dispence In wise proportion, yet from him doth moue All wisdome, and to him hath reference; For as in Power so in Sapience, He doth all other heau'nly Powers transcend, For Wisdome Ground is of Omnipotence, And as we Mortalls on her hests attend, So neerer io diuine perfection we ascend."
22045,"Such is true Wisdom's glory, that eu'n they Seeme much to doubt, who doe her most admire; Whither we properly possesse her may, And by continuall industry acquire; Or that the Heau'ns her secretly inspire: In briefe, no price or gold can her obtaine, Shee seemes to be some flame of heau'nly fire In Adam breath'd, before by Folly slaine, Which therefore we must seeke to haue from heau'n againe."
22046,"Schooles her to be the knowledge doe define Of things diuine, and humane, which in breast Of Mortalls, if it pure and liuely shine Makes him, like God, vnmou'd and stable rest: For as no chance of Fortune can molest The Power diuine, So wisemen doe enioy Within themselues, by Wisdome, Peace, and Rest; Nothing that is without can them annoy, All seeming Miseries giue place to Inward Ioy."
22047,"Yet falls this Wisdome short of that Diuine, Which Adam did possesse before his fall: And as Sun-beames through clouds, so doth she shine Through our corruptions, scarse discern'd at all, Wee common and more exquisite her call; That see things that are past, and things in sight, This things which in succeeding times may fall; Wee her, as shee guides mens affayres aright, Call Prudence; Wisdome, as shee doth in God delight."
22048,"Wisdome and Prudence in an humane breast, Are one same Grace, though diuers by relation: Wisdome referres to God, Prudence doth rest, Most in a wise and vpright moderation Of States and Men by Law's administration: By Wisdome here we see the life of Grace, By Prudence in a ciuill conuersation; Prudence amongst the heathen had a place, True heau'nly wisdome only Gods elect doth grace."
22049,"This heau'nly wisdome, whereby we conuerse With God, and take delight in holy things, Doth our affections all, and wills peruerse Set right, and neere diuine perfection brings; Shee first, like good Musitian, tunes the strings, And then sends forth a most harmonious sound: First lifts our Soules to heau'n vpon her wings, Next orders all by Prudence on the ground, Like Leach who ere he others cure, himselfe makes sound."
22050,"She first within in order sets the heart, Next is for outward things most prouident, No Grace more Good to Mortalls doth impart, Nor none more euills here on earth preuent, She shew's her inward Graces God hath lent; By outward manners, habit, graue attire; Few words, pure hands, in all such complement, Such gesture publike, and in her retire, As all her for a heau'nly patterne doe admire."
22051,"But most of all a wiseman striues to tame Both in himselfe, and others Sin and Lust: For hee that Good from Ill discern's, doth blame False varnish't show's defil'd with inward rust: He Pride, Pompe, Boasting, Scorne away doth thrust, And from a pure Serenity of mind A paterne draw's of Life most quiet, iust; Far from opinions false, and errour blind, And guides at sterne, as in a calme, so in the wind."
22052,"In Warre most valiant, in Iudgement iust; Ill, vnto Good, things hurtfull, turn's to sound; Will's still the same, because the best, no Gust Of fate oppresleth him, if Wealth abound, Or Pouertie, he still the same is found; And doth with pleasing Constancy endure All Fortunes changes, which doe others wound; True, innocent, sincere, iust, simple, pure, And as his Life, his Death is ioyfull, sweet, secure."
22053,"The Poets faine that in the golden Age, Graue, wise, experienc'd men bare all the sway, And the vnexpert, young, not yet growne sage, To learne Law's rules first practis'd to obey, For Prudence all by leuell orders ay, And by a long Experience doth discerne, How she prouide for future changes may, By precept, and example much we learne; But that imprints most deepe, which doth our selues concern."
22054,"Examples, Precepts, and Experience, Are euer ready at a Wisemans hand, To teach him Iudgement, Counsell, Prouidence, Of which we alway's here in need doe stand: By Counsell we the Grounds doe vnderstand Of things we ought to doe, or leaue vndone: Iudgement our Wills and Senses doth command, What things we ought embrace, and what to shun, And Prouidence prouides for things that are to come."
22055,"I praise not here that cunning Politie, Which maketh of anothers Folly, gaine; This comes of Malice, Guile, and Subtiltie, Which generous braue Prudence doth disdaine: Such alway's euill counsell entertaine, The Apes of Prudence, Reasons deprauation, Whose minds (as hands grow hard by taking paine) Are by base plots, and subtill magination Inured vnto others wrongs and supplantation."
22056,"As Quicknesse wit, As Soundnesse memory, Graue lookes the Face, and Plainnesse speech commend; So Iudgements praise is in Equalitie, Without least doing wrong to Foe or Friend: And as salt sauours, so doth Iudgement bend Eu'n all our words, thoughts, workes, to good or ill; Without this Iudgement, Prudence doth intend Nothing; for shee is Mistresse of her Will, Which she with all her power labours to fulfill."
22057,"Counsell and Iudgement are the very eyes And Lamps here, to direct a prudent mind; Which they who want, or foolishly misprise, Walke on in Folly, and in Errour blind: We many ignorant vaine Fooles doe find, So wise in their conceit and estimation; They thinke all wisdome in their breasts confin'd, These being bound by double obligation To Folly, there's no hope of any reformation."
22058,"Prudence and Folly, in the Soule of man, Like Health and Sicknesse in his Body are; As Health the Body keepes, so."
22059,"Prudence can The Soule deliuer from the Deuills snare: And as Diseases here the thread doth share Of Body's Life; So Folly soone doth rend The Soule with pleasures vaine, and worldly care: For as strong men within a Fort defend; So Prudent Thoughts our soules from Satans fury shend."
22060,"And as, among the noble senses fiue, The Sight doth all the rest in worth excell, Because all doe their Light from her deriue, And shee all that offends them doth repell: So Prudence all the vertues doth precell; Because, by Light God sends her from aboue, Shee counsells all the Graces to do well; For without her no Grace aright can moue Prudence of all the rest the Gouernour doth proue."
22061,"Vlisses Prudence, Aiax Fortitude; Whil'st they each other doe accompany Win City's, conquer men, and monsters rude: But if they square for Gaine or Dignity, And Aiax leaues Vlisses company, His valour turnes to Folly or to rage: So men of greatest magnanimity, When they the Guidance leaue of Prudence sage, Grow beastly, mad, or foolish in their later age."
22062,"I may her liken to the Prince of Day, From whom all lesser Lamps doe borrow Light; Who when he doth his glorious Beames display, The rest all seeme to be extinguish't quite: So when as heau'nly Wisdome, wondrous bright, Her selfe amongst the Graces doth disclose, They all doe seeme to vanish in her sight, As all the Glory that they haue arose (dispose."
22063,"From those bright Beames, which wisdome doth on them As God the world, The Emperour his host, The Gouernour his Ship, the Sunne the day, And as the Body's ruled by the Ghost, So doth faire Prudence all the vertues sway: And as these, like good Guides, direct the way Vnto their charge, to reach their proper end: So doth true wisdome, all that her obey To endlesse happinesse and pleasure send; Most happy man who doth her holy hests attend."
22064,"May his heart die like Nabals churle and foole, Or like Achitophel end with a string; Laugh in the stocks, cleaue to the scorners stoole, That listens not to heau'nly counselling Of Wisdome, and her sweet admonishing, Shee hath prouided victualls, powr'd out wine, Sent out her Maids vs to the feast to bring, To bid those that seeke Knowledge come and dine; And those that Prudence want to tast her grapes diuine."
22065,"For shee's the Vine, whose grapes yeeld pleasing smell, Whose Fruit and Flowers, Wealth, Life, Honour are; The Garden where Christ dearest Spouse doth dwell, Planted with all the Herbs and Spices rare, Which to adorne his Church he doth prepare: Would thou one word which should her worth containe  And who know's holy things doth entertaine Right vnderstanding, without this the rest are vaine."
22066,"She as the Prince or Generall doth guide All other Graces in Loues sacred band, Doth order, marshall, and for them prouide, As th' Eye, which all the members doth command: The Gouernours of Men, of Cities, and Of Families, and each mans priuate state, She orders wisely by her prudent hand, And they that duely on Discretion waite, Command the Stars, and rule eu'n ouer Time and Fate."
22067,"As shadow's more directly opposite To Sunnes bright Rayes, seeme short by being neere, When those, which are much farther from the light, More goodly faire and long by farre appeare: So who small Knowledge haue attained here, Thereof doe alway's make a greater show Than those, whose vnderstanding shining cleare, Doe all the Paths of heau'nly wisdome know, For with true Wisdome alway's Humblenesse doth grow."
22068,"And as Gods Wisdome doth no lesser seeme In smallest creatures, as a Gnat or Fly, Than Greater; so we ought no lesse esteeme Wisemen in low degree then Dignitie: The Snaile a mirrour is of Politie, Who with her hornes keepes alway's sentinell, And neuer commeth out before shee try, If things without be all in Peace and well Else she, retyring home, liues quiet in her shell."
22069,Oh sonnes of men that you could but behold!
22070,"The wondrous Beauty of this heau'nly Peare; But nought on earth her Beauty can vnfold Her Glory in the Heau'ns doth shine most cleare; In all Gods workes her splendour doth appeare, She first from Heau'n vouchsafed to descend To liue in Iudah, with her chosen deare: But now her Beames more ample doe extend, To all the Nations of the earth she light doth lend."
22071,"She taught our Father that was made alone, To raise himselfe to Glory from his fall; But Enuy turn'd from her his foolish sonne, And made by Fratricide and Fury fall: Loe when the Floud the world destroyed all, She it preserues by one wise worke of Wood: The dead Sea yet is the memoriall Of foolish City's fiue, which there erst stood, Where she sau'd Lot from fire, as Noah from the sloud."
22072,"To tell what wonders haue beene by her wrought, Were too to long for this short meditation; They in Gods Booke are easily found, if sought, For there indeed is Wisdom's commendation; Where she vs doth, with wary obseruation, Vnto the Cony and the Pismire send, To learne to get our food and habitation, Whose meaner Wisdome if we must attend, Much more wise Heathens sayings most diuinely pend."
22073,"One being asked, who was most wise, reply'd He that sinn'd least; when one of them desir'd To learne who was for youth the trustiest Guid: He answer'd, Prudence: And in's sonne requir'd Only three things, which he in youth admir'd: In his tongue silence; Prudence in his mind; Shamefastnesse in his Face: when one requir'd How he the greatest in the least might find; He answer'd, prudent thoughts in humane breast confin'd."
22074,"This was an Ethnick: But how doth she shine, When she is ioyn'd with pure simplicitie?"
22075,"When as that holy wisdome serpentine, Combines with doue-like true sincerity: Oh thus the Saints by holy subtilty, Walke safe amongst worlds crooked generation: Thus walk'd our Sauiour in Humilitie, And though the wicked plot his condemnation, Yet neuer could they touch him, but by subornation."
22076,Oh how should we that haue this mirrour bright!
22077,"This Sun of Wisdome labour here to shine Like Stars, which from the Sun receiue their light, And to sincerity true columbine, Ioyne this wise holy Prudence serpentine: Vs to conduct through this worlds wildernesse, And a most safe and perfect way out line Through Iordans waues, to Land of Happinesse, Where Mansions ready built, we shall for ay possesse."
22078,"And Vineyards planted, whence the Cananite, For wicked Treason 'gainst his Maiesty, God hath expell'd to Hell, and darkest night, Proud Lucifer and all his company: Oh why should'st thou aduance base dust so high!"
22079,"Whose earthly Mansion keepes his Spirit low, And will not let his vnderstanding flye To see what goodly clusters there doe grow, In heau'nly Canaan, where Milke and Hony flow."
22080,"We hardly here of things below discerne, And with great paines what is before vs find; Ah how shall we than able be to learne Thy Wisdome, which no limits haue confin'd: Thy Spirit onely can into our mind These hidden mysteries, in Christ reueale, In which the Princes of the world were blind; For from man naturall thou dost conceale This Wisdome spirituall, which thou to thine do'st deale."
22081,"For as none know's the Spirit of a man, But that same Spirit that within doth dwell: So nothing apprehend this Wisdome can But that wise Spirit that all Truth doth tell, Oh Sacred Spirit of Truth!"
22082,"my heart compell This holy Sapience to entertaine, Thou only giu'st to drinke of Wisdom's Well; Mans wisdom's wickednesse, his thoughts are vaine, His knowledge is but errour, and his pleasure paine."
22083,"Thou didst create eu'n all things by thy Word, And by thy heau'nly Wisdome didst ordaine Man of thy handy workes to be the Lord, That he in Truth and Equitie might raigne, And with an vpright heart the right maintaine: Oh therefore downe thine heau'nly wisdome send, Me in all Truth and vprightnesse to traine, She shall my Words and Works to thee commend, And bring my small beginnings to a perfect end."
22084,"And here with Praise and Prayer I will end, Oh who aright can know or vnderstand, Except thou Wisdome from thy Throne do'st send, To giue vnto him what thou dost command: Then grant me Wisdome alway's to withstand Hells subtill Plots, and Worlds base Blandiments, Let sacred Prudence euer be at hand, Still to direct my words, acts, and intents, To yeeld Obedience to thy Commandements."
22085,"WHen first th' Almighty, by his only Word, Had fashion'd all within the Firmament: He made Man last, to be their King and Lord, That he to him might be obedient: But Man not with this Monarchy content, Diuide his homage to omnipotence; And hauing but one small Commandement, Transgressed it by Disobedience: The easier the Command, the greater the Offence."
22086,"This all the Sonnes of Adam doe deriue From him, and call it guilt Originall, Which by th' Eternall Law did vs depriue Of all Gods Benefits, and did enthrall To endlesse Bondage, till Christ for this Fall, The price of his most precious bloud did pay, Which vs recouers from Sins actuall, And by obeying Gods whole Law, doth stay His wrath, And merits Heau'n for all that him obay."
22087,"For as by first mans Disobedience On all men commeth Death and Condemnation; So by the seconds true Obedience, We haue eternall Life, and sure Saluation: Thus Disobedience, by deriuation From Adam, bringeth endlesse wretchednesse, And true Obedience, by imputation Conuay's from Christ eternall Happinesse; So by the first comes sin, by second Righteousnesse."
22088,"The glorious robe of perfect Righteousnesse, Which they that are obedient onely weare, To couer that foule shame and wickednesse, Which Adams Disobedience layed bare: Ah!"
22089,"let a Disobedient Sinner dare, The aid of the Obedient Lamb desire, My Will and Actions, Tongue and Heart to square, In due proportion to his heau'nly squire, Whil'st I of true Obedience prayses doe enquire."
22090,"Handmaid to the Queene Of heau'nly Loue, And so in duty bound, That shee's alway's prest and ready seene, To doe what thing soeuer she propound: Her heart, words, will and deeds all one are found, Seruing for Loue, and not for Feare or Gaine, No Subiect merits better to be crown'd; For who can best obay, he best can raigne, And she is shortly sure, eternall Crownes to gaine."
22091,"If I may square Her by the Rules of Art, I her define to be our Wills subiection To Him, that ought to rule both will and heart, And by his will disposeth our best affection: The rule of Reason may be our direction, How our superiours Statutes we obay; But when the Lord commands, there's no election Nor doubting, what we ought to doe or say, Gods will's the rule of Right, which none may disobey."
22092,"Here in two Branches, I might her diuide, Obedience first to God, and secondly To our Superiours, that on earth abide, But all is but to one Authority: For there's no Power or precedency, But that which highest Power doth ordaine; Who therefore doth resist mans Soueraignty, Gods ordinance resisteth, and againe Who duly it obay's, Gods Statutes doth maintaine."
22093,"Thus must our hearts, eares, hands be all attent His Word and Will in all things to obey, Who ouer vs hath lawfull Regiment, Which is one God, eternall, blest for ay; Whose seruants all we are, And therefore may Not chuse a Lord, or Master whom we will, Nor serue two masters, least we disobay The one, when we the others mind fulfill, For that which pleaseth one, doth crosse the others will."
22094,"Thus our obedience is only due To him, that all did for his seruice make; And 'tis a firme position sound and true; God only for himselfe; But for his sake,  We truly and sincerely ought obey: Or else our bounden dutie we forsake, As those which doe their Princes disobey, When they their lawfull Officers commands gainsay."
22095,"For this whole world is like a family, In all things well and iustly ordered; Where God hath the supreame authority, And Rulers theirs from him deliuered, By which they doe command as in his stead; Who then to them are disobedient, They may be said to disobey the Head: For whil'st they rightly vse their gouernment, We ought them to obey in things indifferent."
22096,"Indeed all ought regard the Supreme Will, As first commanding cause, and end of all; Which all that Being haue, ought to fulfill, From which as all things rise, so all must fall; Here therefore first, we into mind will call: To whom that will commands vs to obay, For in obeying their commands we shall Obey that Supreme Will: This is the way To make Gods Will the Cause, of all we doe or say."
22097,"To Him; we must be subiect, first of all, To whom all Power in Heau'n and Earth is lent; The Sonne of God begotten, naturall, Next to his Ministers, which he hath sent: Apostles, Pastors, Doctors, here are meant; Which by his Word doe teach their Masters Will, And rule his Church, by godly Gouernment, And those, which heare these, his commands fulfill, And those which them despise, despise his heau'nly Will."
22098,"As Kings, which with great Honour doe conuay Princes Ambassadours, it doe intend Vnto their Lords, So we our Lord obay When we obey the Legates he doth send: The second Power is that which God doth lend To Kings and Princes, for to delegate Iudges, to punish those which doe offend, And to maintaine the Life, Peace, and estate Of eu'ry member, that maintaines the Bodies state; To this all Subiects owe Obedience; The third obedience is, which wife doth owe Vnto her Head, who due Beneuolence For Dutie, ought vnto his wife to shew: For as the Church, so ought the Wife to know Her due Subiection vnto her Head, And as our Christ directs his Church below: So wiues must be by husbands ordered, But this of wiues is better knowne, then practised."
22099,"So is th' obedience, which Children owe Vnto their Parents, by Commandement And promise, they shall long, and good day's know, If they to them will be obedient."
22100,"The fift and last is Masters Gouernment, And Seruants Duty which they should them beare, Which ought to be with single true intent, Not for eye-seruice, wages, or for feare; But as they would obey eu'n Christ their Master deare."
22101,"Thus ought we to obey these fiue degrees, Set ouer vs: Because we so obay The highest Power, And if their iust decrees We sleight, that highest Power we disobay: Far wide then disobedient spirits stray, Which by Religion, would all reuerence Exclude, due vnto Magistrates, and say They vnto no man owe obedience, A false excuse of Schisme and all vnreuerence."
22102,"Obedience preserueth Vnity, And helpeth to this great worlds conseruation, As Heau'ns and Earth doe by due Obsequy Obey their glorious Makers Ordination; Behold how all things in this worlds Creation, Doe by their Makers order stand or moue; Earth keepes her Center for mans preseruation, The Heau'ns turne all in motion round aboue, Without Obedience one would out another shoue."
22103,"And thus we may Obedience obserue, To hold our members in due motion ay, Whil'st one doth to another member serue, And all vnto the Spirit doe obay, The Soule of man, which doth by reason sway Eu'n all the members, to their preseruation, And if the least of them doe disobay, Shee either seekes their better reformation, Or one endangers all, to endlesse condemnation."
22104,"For whilst man here doth on the earth remaine, Sin and corruption in his Body dwell: Seeking therein as Lord and King to raigne, But Grace doth striue by force them to expell: If bondslaues we our selues to Sin doe sell, And giue our members here Lusts to obay, We yeeld vnto such Lusts as lead to Hell; But if that Grace our Soule aright doth sway, Then all the members follow Her the narrow way."
22105,"Remoue this Vertue of Obedience From Soule or Body, Subiect, City, Towne, Or from the Creatures wanting life and sense, And all vnto Confusion tumble downe: The Tower of Babel might to Heau'n haue growne, Had all obay'd with mutuall diligence: But suddainly we see it ouerthrowne, When to obay they want intelligence, For without vnderstanding no Obedience."
22106,"As to maintaine Heau'ns perfect vnitie, All to one surpeame Trinity obay; So all that haue with it Affinitie, Subiect themselues to that one God for ay: No wonder if those that him disobay, To many Errours, Schismes, and Sects doe fall, For one true Vnity they doe gainsay, When they resist his Ordinances shall, And disobey Gods Word, that here directeth all."
22107,"Mee thinkes my Muse could here her selfe transcend, By musing of th' obedience aboue, Which from the Sonne to Father doth ascend, And Angells, who obeying Feare and Loue, Alas what can th' eternall Power moue!"
22108,"Obedience of poore wretches to require, But vs to ioyne to Christ our Head in Loue, As he is ioy'nd to God in due desire, Vnto no other end Obedience doth aspire."
22109,"For as when in a wild and fruitlesse stocke We doe some noble impe inoculate; The fruit erst base and wild, like to the Blocke, Is made as goodly, faire, and delicate As Tree which first this imp did generate: So the least imp of Christs Obedience, In vs ingraft, doth vs regenerate; And makes vs beare fruit of like excellence, As liuely tree, from which it first had influence."
22110,"For all that from stocke of first Adam come, Beare those sowre fruits of Disobedience; But all, that doe ingraft againe become In second Adams true Obedience, Bring forth sweet fruits, like liuely tree, from whence They haue receiued first their sap to spring; Swee liuing Vine!"
22111,"whose sacred influence, Vs makes obedient to our Lord and King, Ah!"
22112,who the praises of thy noble fruit can sing?
22113,"It did aduance that holy Prophets quill, When He in volume of the booke did find, Written, that thou shouldst Gods whole Law fulfill, Whereto thou wert withall thine heart inclin'd: And when the time was come thereto assign'd, Thou wert obedient to all Gods will, Performing it with all thine heart and mind, Ev'n till the Iewes thee on the Crosse did kill, When thou resisted'st not, though they thy bloud did spill."
22114,"this was the sacrifice, The offering God did for sin require; Thus We must offer vp to God, likewise Our Soules and Body's, with like zealous fire To dye, if not indeed, yet in desire: Quick, holy, acceptable Offering, To pacifie Gods Iustice and his Ire, Is when to him obedient hearts we bring And crucifie those Lusts, which from our Flesh doe spring."
22115,"As from the boundlesse Ocean doe run All streames which doe returne into the Maine, So from one paterne of Obedience come All ours, and thither doth returne againe; The Lamb that was from worlds beginning slaine Gaue the first blow to Disobedience, Which Isaack imitates when he is laine, On Altar to be sacrificed thence, Whom truly Abram offer'd by Obedience."
22116,"This was that quiet sauour God did smell, When offring one of each cleane bird and beast, The good old Noah pleas'd the Lord so well; Obedience was the Seasoning to the feast: What made the Lord Sauls sacrifice detest?"
22117,"But that he did his Word then disobey, When he did spare of Amalec the best, To offer vp: But therein did obay His own corrupt inuentions, not what God did say."
22118,"Better then Sacrifice is to obay, And then the fat of Rams to giue good eare, Happy though we doe all the world gaine say, If we obay our Lord and Master deare: But ah!"
22119,"whil'st we remaine as Pilgrims here, Flesh, World, and Deuill daily vs perswade To follow Pleasures vaine, and to forbeare Obedience to the Lord, which vs hath made, Whose Statutes to obey should be our onely trade."
22120,Oh Sacrifice of Fooles!
22121,"with tongue to pray, But harbour no obedience in thine heart; Who dost in word professe God to obay, But by thy workes dost all his Law's peruert: Behold!"
22122,"it is not without iust desert That Beasts to thee are disobedient, When thou to God a faithlesse rebell art, To whom obey Sun, Moone, Stars, Firmament, Nor Sea against his will inuades the Continent."
22123,"Whil'st I about, this sinfull Body beare, Lusts and corruptions will therein remaine; Yet neuer let them so much domineere As here of Grace, the mastery to gaine: For if I suffer Sinne in me to raigne, That all my members will to sinne obay, That sin whereof Saint Paul doth so complaine, Oh!"
22124,who me from the same deliuer may!
22125,"It is not I, but sin that Christ doth disobay."
22126,"If that the Iudge by his Authoritie, Inioyne me to performe or speake a thing, Against the will of Soueraigne Maiestie, Here my Deniall no Offence doth bring; And if I be commanded by the King, To doe against his will, that is aboue, I here no Rebell am, though suffering: For I were better Crosse and Prison proue, Than in Gehenna fry, from whence is no remoue."
22127,"And as in all humane societies, The meaner Power the greater doth obay, Till to the Peramount it doth arise, Which Power all inferiour powers sway: So in this Power Spirituall we may, Behold like order for Obedience, The Peramount is Gods high Power ay; For though we doe all Powers reuerence, Yet to the highest we haue alway's reference."
22128,"What more vniust, than looke to be obay'd, By our inferiours, and to disobay Those God hath plac'd aboue vs for our aid, Ah how, Thy will be done may we here pray, As Angells doe the same in Heau'n for ay: Which we so often crosse by doing ill, More often then are minutes in a day Oh let my Heart be ready to fulfill!"
22129,Mine Heart be ready Lord!
22130,to learne and doe thy will.
22131,"Ready in all things lawfull to obay Superiours all, to doe things iust and right, To Loue my Neighbour; for mine enemy's pray, Grace to embrace, and with Corruptions fight, To cast off earthly things, and to delight Wholly in God, and heau'nly contemplation; To worke by day, to watch and pray by night, To learne of Christ, Meeknesse, Humiliation, With trembling and with Feare to worke out my Saluation."
22132,"Since I must be obedient to the end, How should I end to beg Obedience?"
22133,"Obedience, which to Liberty doth tend, And vs restores vnto that excellence Which Adam lost by Disobedience."
22134,"Let others glory in their mightie traine, And large command of many Continents; By Meeknesse and Obedience I shall gaine, With Meeke obedient Lamb in Heau'n for ay to raigne."
22135,"AS in faire Garden, where variety Of choisest Flowers, the senses to delight, Are plac't by cunning hand, most curiously, Their diuers colours most effect the sight, That broad and fairest shew and stand vpright, But oft we find low creeping on the ground, An hearb, whose odour sweet doth more inuite Our smells, than all the Tuslips there are found; So is it with this Grace, which I doe next propound."
22136,"For though the goodliest Garden of the Bride, Like Eden is so faire embelished With richest Fruits and Flowers, from side to side, Their names and hues cannot be numbered, Much lesse their Force and Natures be aread: And though all are more glorious to be seene, Than Meeknesse, which is next disciphered: Yet none more pleasing to our smell I weene, Nor more, than her, respected of Loues royall Queene."
22137,"Obedience, Meeknesse, and Humility Are Flowers, more for profit than for show, Pleasing the smell and taste more than the eye, And lowly like sweet Thyme and Hysope grow; These by the outward face we must not know, Their inward vertue 'tis that we esteeme Their Force is heau'nly, though their dwellings low, And may the greatest Monarch here be-seeme, For sure the King of Kings like these himselfe did deeme."
22138,"And vs commandeth all of him to learne Meeknesse and lowlinesse, which rest doth bring, Eternall Rest, which doth our Soules concerne Here more than any vaine and worldly thing: Most mighty God, and yet the meekest King?"
22139,"Fit thou my Soule for this sweet Meditation; And teach me meeknesse, whil'st I meeknesse sing, Which base and meane in mans vaine estimation, Is with the Lord of Lords of highest valuation."
22140,"Some her define to be a Moderation Of Anger: And would haue her to abstaine From all reuengefull furious, enuious passion, Thereby possession of her soule to gaine: For who doth gentle meeknesse entertaine, With her finds happy Peace, and quiet Rest; And who from furious rage will not refraine, But harbours wrath, and malice in his Brest, Possesseth not himselfe, but is by them possest."
22141,"and kind, In words, though diuers are, in sense the same; And come from gentle habit of the mind, Which like it selfe our words and acts doth frame, Making wild, sauage, furious creatures tame, For all are mad and wild since Adams fall, And burne in furious and reuengfull flame, But meeknesse mitigates appeasing all, And blessed here in peace the earth inherit shall."
22142,"Meeknesse which pleaseth God, and profits man, For God the meeke exalteth to Saluation; And those which here abstaine from Anger can, In multitude of Peace haue delectation: With meeke far better is humiliation, Than greatest spoiles with proud ones to diuide, Heau'nly Hierusalem's no habitation For those, which Right by Duells doe decide, But those which can with meeknesse iniury's abide."
22143,"She ire and rancour in her heart can brooke, But doth all with an equall mind sustaine; Prouok'd by none, nor doth she one prouoke, Though oft offended hurteth none againe: She doth from all improbity abstaine, Resists not euill, but the same with good Still ouercomes, And doth more glory gaine By gentle yeelding, than if she withstood The wicked in his raging, furious angry mood."
22144,Oh Grace most glorious!
22145,"when God Her sends To dwell in breast of some great Potentate: His Heart She from all Crueltie defends, And though he be a Lord of Life and Fate, His hands with bloud doth not contaminate; She such a Prince to Heau'n at length will bring, Too soone for vs; though he may thinke it late: Let Homer fierce Achilles praises sing, Giue me a mercifull, meeke, mild, and gentle King."
22146,"For Meeknesse brings more honour to a King, Than Purple, Scepter, Diademe, or Crowne, And richer triumphs doth to Emperours bring, Than winning any Castle, Fort, or Towne: He gets eternall Glory and renowne; Who can by meeknesse bridle passions right, Let Tyrants rage, and let the Fury's frowne; They can no more a good meeke man affright, Than Arrow's hurt the water that thereon doe light."
22147,"Inhumane cruelty's taught in the schoole Of Satan; who would like himselfe haue all; But he whose seats in Heau'n, and his footstoole Vpon the earth; Before whose presence fall Downe all the Angells, and him Maker call, Bids vs like to himselfe be meeke and low, For he that turn'd to sweet that cup of gall, Can make the meeke and lowly highest grow, And with one blast the proud and cruell ouerthrow."
22148,"I labour not to keepe downe or depresse, That humane natures high sublimitie, Without which creatures beare no awfulnesse Nor due respect vnto the Maiesty God hath annexed to mans Soueraignty: I seeke to suit his mind and conscience, Vnto his outward Grace and Dignity, And raise him by an inward confidence Of wel-knowne worth, to an angelike excellence."
22149,"Yet not by this sublimity to swell Beyond the bounds of Mortalls, He that's wise Will, as his worth and due deserts excell, Be still more low and humble in's owne eyes: And as his State and Honour here doe rise, Hee is more modest, gentle, meeke, and kind, Preferring not himselfe in any wise Before his equalls: thus he grace doth find, By gentle manswetude, with God and all mankind."
22150,"For whilst by an obsequious conuersation, And by ingenuous manners, pleasing, sweet; Far from base flattery, as vaine ostentation Hee doth inferiours, equalls, betters greet, By loosing of his owne; Lo he doth get, In others thoughts the highest estimation; His Head's in heau'n, though on the earth his feet; And by anothers vertues veneration, He getteth of his owne all loue and admiration."
22151,"Oh happy man to whom heau'ns King hath sent, This Grace to be the glory of the rest; What can that mind molest or discontent, That harbours gracious meeknesse in his brest: They that can contumely faire disgest, If any them deride or reprehend, Streight of themselues take more seuere inquest, If ought be iustly blam'd, they soone amend, If false, it neuer them shall anger or offend."
22152,"Meeke, gentle, patient, bearing right or wrong; From inward free, as outward perturbation, Reuenge is not a thing that doth belong To her; she finds far greater contentation In wrongs dissembling, and their tolleration: The wants, which she within her selfe doth find, Her more depresse by modest moderation, Than all her vertues eleuate her mind, As salt she sauours all the vertues in their kind."
22153,"This is the same, or very like the Grace, Which we doe call Christian Humilitie Without which other vertues haue no place, All are in her as in an Vnitie: She is the surest way to Dignitie, The center where all vertues lines doe meet, Most honour'd when she most doth vilifie Her selfe, And when she stoops to wash Saints feet, The highest King of Kings, with kisses her doth greet."
22154,"Yet none of worldlings is esteem'd more vile, They it account a thing too meane and base, Here to discend vnto so low a stile; They thinke that meeknesse valour doth disgrace: But oh absurd, presumptuous, mortall race; So high and proud in thine owne estimation, What thing's created in more wretched case?"
22155,"Weake vaine precipite, and on each occasion, Ready to fall from highest hopes to desperation."
22156,What is thy Body but fraile quickned clay?
22157,"Thy Soule's so clouded with obscurity; It is most ready, prone, precipite ay, To fall to basenesse, errour, vanity: Happy who sees his owne infirmity; Thus By discending only we ascend Vnto the highest humane dignity: First step to honour is to vilipend Our selues: Let others thee and not thy selfe commend."
22158,"None seekes to pull his foot out of the mire, Vntill he feeles and know's that it is in, Nor none to wash the durt off doth desire, Vntill he sees it cleaue vnto his skin: So till this Grace vs shew's our selues within, We neuer seeke those heau'nly remedies, To purge our soules from error and foule sinne; This was of all the Oracles most wise, First, know thy selfe: that is thine owne infirmities."
22159,"Thus comes the purest wheat from foulest ground, So it be first well till'd and harrowed, And thus the ignorant, grow men profound, When they their folly haue discouered, Of all the vertues can be reckoned; The roots are bitter, fruits most sweet doe proue, Selfe Pride, and Arrogance once settled In humane Brest, most hard are to remoue, This worke belongs to meeknesse, humblenesse and Loue."
22160,"Most pleasant fruits, which from this root do spring, When weeding out base pleasures false and vaine, She true delight into their roomes doth bring And rich Content, for euer to remaine, Happy who can this Lady's fauour gaine; Shee able is and ready to defend, Against Soules troubles, and the body's paine; The meeke, that patiently on God attend, Are sure to haue a joyfull, quiet, happy end."
22161,"Nothing can his most noble mind appall, Which is with such Tranquillity indude; Crosses, Afflictions may him here befall, But base or abiect thoughts cannot intrude Into a mind of such an habitude: Certaine his breast all vertues doth containe, Who hath this gentle vertue manswetude Who wants her boasts of vertue but in vaine, They are but shew's of vertue, which with him remaine."
22162,"It is the height of folly to bewray Desire, where we haue no power to offend: So beat the Sea, if it will not obay, Or winds which crosse the way thou dost intend: So whom thou canst not reach his picture rend, Such wounds make arrow's, when they cleane the aire; Yet many thus with rage their spirits spend, Were it not better farre to beare them faire, But Folly cannot beare, though thou in morter bray her."
22163,"If an Asse kicks thee, must thou kicke againe?"
22164,"Or barks a Dog, wilt thou straight baule and cry; Because one's foolish, canst thou not refraine?"
22165,"But needs doe that is ill for company: Let fooles scorne meane Birth, want, deformity; This (if a fault) not thine, thy Makers is, To him that's meeke no infelicity Can fall by Fortunes bitter frownes or blisse, He counts them not his owne, true vertue's only his."
22166,"I liken Meeknesse to that peece of wood, Wherewith the Prophet did the Fountaines heale; And made the bitter waters sweet and good, For so doth Meeknesse with Afflictions deale, She all their bitternesse with Ioy doth seale, Ev'n that accursed death vpon a Tree, She turneth from a Curse, vnto our Weale; Blest are the Meeke, that for well-doing be Hang'd thereupon: from thence they Paradise may see."
22167,"A meeke mans mind's like solitary place, Where all is quiet, fit for Contemplation; And to behold his Makers Will and Grace, Spending his time in sweetest meditation; But cruell minds are full of perturbation, Like to a Market or tumultuous Faire, Where all is fill'd with noise and molestation; Durt in the streets, strong clamours in the aire: Such places are vnfit, for Graces sweet repaire."
22168,"A meeke mind's like vnto Pernassus Hill, Through whose pure aire shines Phoebus golden ray; Whose siluer Channells purest Fountaine fill, And all the meades bedeck with Lilly's gay: The Gardens with faire Flowers adorned ay, And when the Brookes doe murmur any sound; With much delight sweet Zephirus doth play, And all the Birds vpon the trees around, Consort with Muses nine to make a Heav'nly sound."
22169,"But a meeke mind more pleasing is then all These Flowers, Fruits, or Musickes sweet delight; No fit of Fury can that Heart appall; For as a Dart may on the water light, And hurts it not by any force or might: So Force, not Fury can meeke mind offend, For it giues way as doth the water light, Oh happy quiet mind!"
22170,"that doth attend, With meeknesse on Gods bounteous goodnesse to the end."
22171,"As when the glorious Sun-beames doe appeare, All misty cloudinesse is turn'd to day, So where this Grace the heart of men doth cheare, All passions turbulent are driu'n away: Then mecknesse most her Glory doth display, When shee hath iustest cause to take offence, No valour like this Dames behold we may, Nor any like her modest Patience; A meeke and lowly mind excells all ornaments."
22172,"As when the Lord of all to vs did come In humane flesh, he peace and concord bred Twixt Men and Angells, and made all become As one, in peace, and quiet in their head; So where this meeknesse doth her Grace dispred, There Nations, Neighbours, Kindred, all we find Lately at Discord, now fast fettered In Loue, and Friendships Bands, which firmly bind No surer band of loue, than meeke and gentle mind."
22173,"In golden Age, when as the Poets faine Men, Beasts, Fish, Foule to be at amity, This Lady Mecknesse as a Queene did raigne, And vnder Loue had all Authoritie: But since the Iron Age, which enmity Hath rais'd in eu'ry Riuer, Towne, and Field, Shee hath resign'd her place of Soueraigntie To Iustice, and delights now more to yeeld, Than Scepters in age so turbulent to weel'd."
22174,"And for she know's the noble gentle mind Most sensible of wrong and iniury: And few or none can here so constant find, As to dissemble foule indignity She all requests that loue her company, Occasions to auoid and not inuite; Which may prouoke least iarre or simulty, Aed not like teachy Curres to barke and bite, Or Frogs, which Poets faine with Bulrushes to fight."
22175,"If thus they cannot, as who ay can here?"
22176,"Auoid some iniury's of them that reigne, They must dissemble, and with pleasing cheere, What they can no wayes shift, faire entertaine: One ask'd, how such old age he did attaine In Court; reply'd by bearing Iniury's, Sometimes remitting, and sometimes againe, For them gaue thankes, thus surely he that's wise, By suffring beares, and not prouokes indignities."
22177,"And since no earthly Power's so great and firme, But Iniury sometimes will dare to smite, Let Wisdom's precepts so thee ay confirme, Thou neuer swerue from rules of Reason right: So arm'd the wrongs which on thine armor light, Shall backe on him that sent the same rebound; But whom vnarm'd she can prouoke to fight, Though happily they thinke her to confound, They sure are to receiue a deepe and festring wound."
22178,"He stands not right, whom Iniury can bow, Who ill beare old, doe on them new inuite; But he that beares the old with Patience: how Shall any new be able him to smite?"
22179,"He that is wise and valiant scornes her might, And by braue bearing doth her spite confound, He best o'recomes that sets by her most light, Who by impatience, addes, is like him found, That doth, by rending make incurable his wound."
22180,"In many wrongs 'tis better to be mute, Than by repeating them, oft very small, To cause long trouble or a tedious suit, Whilst all the shame doth on th'auenger fall: Such better were not mentioned at all: Inuoke the helpe of constant Patience, Whose presence doth all Iniury's appall, And with an equall mind beares all offence, Or doth despise them in her guiltlesse conscience."
22181,"Thus many, offring, doe no Iniury's, Because they are not so conceiv'd or taken; Oh happy who all wrong can so despise, With sense thereof ne're to be ouertaken; Whose vnmov'd constant mind is neuer shaken; So farre from muttring or least murmuring, He laughs and smiles to see them so mistaken, Nor's only easie in their pardoning; But passeth by them without least acknowledging."
22182,"He is aboue the reach of Iniuries, Who can represse reuenges curst desire, And to the full repay's his enemies, Who thus can quench wraths hot iniurious fire."
22183,"Yet holy meeknesse leads vs a step higher: Happy who can ascend vnto such height It is the summity, which all admire, Of highest vertue, when we take delight All Iniury's with Benefits here to requite."
22184,"The jest is lost, if it no laughter moue, So's Contumely if it be neglected; He neuer will a valiant Souldier proue To beare hot Blow's, that is with words affected: He sooner is with noisome smells infected, Who them with open nose doth entertaine; Than he that stops it, or beares some selected Preseruatiue for to defend his braine: So 'tis to stop or ope our eares to proud Disdaine."
22185,"Poets paint Scylla with a womans face, But like a Dog in neather parts and taile, Whom Hercules, th' Idea of all Grace And Vertue, did amongst the monsters quaile, You giue her Life, if you will heare her raile: But shut her mouth with patient suffering, Or stop thine eares, and soone her breath will faile: Here Mecknesse ends, and here I cease to sing, Shee doth more quiet Rest than all the Vertues bring."
22186,"SO mighty are the weapons manifold, Wherewith our spirituall Foes doe vs assaile; So many stratagems vs to infold, So many terrours vaine, our hearts to quaile, That neither Brestplate, Helmet, Shield or Maile Vs helpe against their Forces can afford; For if they close with vs, they will preuaile, Therefore we must vnsheath our keenest Sword: Our weapon spirituall, ev'n Gods most holy Word."
22187,"Which those that able are to wield aright, Of farre more Force, and liuely Power find, Than all the weapons whereof Poets write, To haue beene wondrous pow'rfull in their kind: What Homer of Achilles Speare hath coyn'd, I not vnfitly to this Sword apply; Whose wounds to heale, no Balme could be assign'd, The Speare that hurt, must only remedy; So whom this Sword doth kill, this Sword must viuifie."
22188,"Of wondrous weapons Heathen Poets tell Of Stygian Armour, and enchanted Swords; Whereby small Knights, did monstrous Gyants quell, Subdude, and raigned ouer them as Lords, Such fiction to vs good aduice affords, Against these Gyants spirituall to fight, Our Fleshly Lusts, and for to bind in Cords, Our vaine affections here that take delight, In doing that is wrong, and leauing that is right."
22189,"God of all might, that hast vs giu'n this sword, Not only spirituall Battailes here to fight, But dost engraue in it, as on record Thy Rules, whereby we muster may aright; The Lanthorne to our paths, our feets best light, Direct my Muse to sing I humbly pray Of this thy Word, by holy Words insight, For but by it, none can aright display That Swords eternall Power, which Sin and Hell dismay."
22190,"That Word, which in Beginning, by a word Of Nothing made, Heau'n, Earth, and Creatures all, And was from all Beginning God and Lord, Doth not within my Muses compasse fall: That Word whereof now meditate I shall, Is that reuealed written veritie, Which first and second Testament we call: Both which were first declared mightily By wonders, signes, and miracles from God on high."
22191,"For as the Lord most mighty wonders wrought, By him, that publikely did first record This sacred Word; And by his Hand forth brought His Sonnes from Bondage of a cruell Lord: So those to whom he did this Grace afford, Of publishing his later Testament, Wrought mighty wonders by this mighty Word, To all Beholders great astonishment, Confirming thus, that they from God aboue were sent."
22192,"From whom this Word hath all Authority, For by the holy Spirits inspiration, Came Law, and Gospell, Prophets, History, And all Canonicall wise ordination: The sacred Light, that giues illumination Vntill the Day-starre in our Hearts arise: Whose heau'nly Wisdome breedeth Admiration In all their Hearts, that are diuinely wise, But folly seemes to such as sinne doth blind their ey's."
22193,"And sure it is a mighty pow'rfull Word, If that the sense thereof be right apply'd, More keene than any sharpe two edged sword, And eu'n the Soule and Spirit doth diuide: By it are all our Hearts intents descry'd, The ioynts and marrow it doth smite in sunder, No Creature from her sight it selfe can hide, All high exalted things it bringeth vnder: And 'gainst all disobedience soundeth out like thunder."
22194,"This was the Sword, wherewith our valiant Head, When he was tempted in the Wildernesse, And with a six-weekes-fast sore weakened, Did free himselfe from Hells malitiousnesse: When first on him his Enemy did presse, He vs'd the hilts himselfe for to defend, But when he could not thus his Foe represse; Loe he the point, against his Breast doth bend; Behind me, Satan, All, Gods worship must attend."
22195,"Those, that will vse aright this holy Word, Must not the letter, but the sense apply; Or else they vse the Scabbard for the Sword, Wherewith none euer wun the Victory: It is the Mystery of Iniquitie, To take the letter, and to leaue the sense, To forge of Antichrists Idolatry, The feigned Rocke, the Key's of Heau'n from whence He claimes to vniuersall Power, Obedience."
22196,"A multitude of words, but all one sense, And tending all to that grand mystery, To which all mysteries haue reference, Mans personall vnion with the Deity: The which to God was knowne infallibly In his election, ere the worlds Foundation, And all the Bookes it seemes to typifie From Genesis vnto the Reuelation, Sublime, transcendent mystery's of mans Saluation."
22197,"How should my Muse these hope to comprehend, In this short fainting breath of meditation; Which doth all humane wit and skill transcend, Whose each word hath an hid signification: Each letter, pricke, and point, an obseruation, All fauouring of Wisdome, true, diuine, And far beyond mans weake inuestigation, In it such rare profound deepe Learning shine, A Volume is not able to expound a Line."
22198,"Fie then on those, that swolne with vaine ambition To sway all Kingdomes with materiall sword; Preferre before this Word, their vaine tradition, Which nought but vainnesse, like themselues afford: Their names be wiped out of the Record And Booke, which all thy Saints names doth containe; That thus doe seeke to vilifie this Word, Which to accomplish Gods owne Sonne was slaine, And thousand Martyrs spent their bloud it to maintain."
22199,"So deale with Prophets, that to hide conspire From simple people, Food spirituall; Which they, as new borne Babes do milke desire, That they may grow vp to be strong and tall: I grant as Mothers breasts doe, best of all Nourish the Child, so doth Gods holy Word, Which from our Mother-Churches breasts doth fall, Best nourishment vnto her Babes afford; So as it be sincere: Else be it all abhor'd."
22200,True Angells Food!
22201,"sweet Manna, pure, diuine, My Spirits dayly bread, and nourishment, Which wanting shee doth hunger, statue and pine, And yeeld to Body's sleshly Regiment: My Soule with fat and marrow is content, When I with ioyfull lips thy praises sing, And feed upon thy Lawes great wonderment; Which to subiection doth my Body bring, And makes the Spirit rule, and order like a King."
22202,"The Spirit it compares to Looking Glasse, Where we our Faces Spots may all behold; But soone out of our memory they passe, Like to a Dreame or Tale that's idlely told: But who his mind thereon doth daily hold, Doth walke in perfect Law of Liberty, Which to him doth apparantly vnfold His Soule and Fleshes least deformity, And sheweth him the meanes the same to rectifie."
22203,"Eu'n as the Raine indiffereutly doth fall, Vpon the fruitfull, and the barren ground; So preached is this Heau'nly Word to all, Though to the faithlesse, it be fruitlesse found, Oh!"
22204,"where this Word doth powerfully sound, The strongest holds of sin it shatters downe; And things most high exalted doth confound, It's smallest-Seed in lowly Valley sowne, Est suddenly is to a mighty Cedar growne."
22205,"It is reported of the siluer Doue, She neere the purest Streames doth most delight; In which Shee may espy the shadow moue, Of towring Faulcon, or the rauenning Kite; Whereby she is forewarn'd to scape by flight, From cruell Hawkes, that seeke her for a pray!"
22206,"So if in spirituall streames we take delight, Our spirituall Foes we there discouer may, That so our Soules forewarn'd, like Doues might flye away."
22207,Most glorious Sun-shine!
22208,"where it doth enlight, More comfortable Light hath showne; But when Shee doth withdraw her Beames, is night And darknesse spirituall, far grosser growne, Than that which three day's was to Pharaoh knowne; Hard-hearted Pharaoh, thou that didst despise, This Word and all the wonders by it showne, Eu'n all thy plagues light on them that deuise, To hide this heau'nly Light; from simple peoples ey's."
22209,"It is the doore, whereby the pastours may Spiritually ascend into their Fold, Those that doe enter in another way We doe as rauenning wolues and robbers hold: This Word's a touchstone, which doth try from Gold All mettalls base, Inuentions of mans braine, Of which such store at Latium now are sold, Not for the Flocks, but for the Shepheards gaine, Masse, Dirges, Pardons, Trentalls, and Traditions vaine."
22210,"Nothing describe her nature better will, Than Touchstone: th'vse of which simplest may learne, But one had need of cunning Gold-smiths skill; True Touchstone from a false one to discerne, Oh how did those noble Berreans earne!"
22211,"To try those things that Paul deliuered, The things which our Saluation did concerne, By that which in the Scriptures they had read, The Scriptures that the Spirit had canonized."
22212,"Who from the simple people these doe hide, Deale as with Israel did the Cananite, Who no Smith suffer'd in their Coasts t'abide, To make a weapon for an Israelite: Therfore no speare, nor sword when they should fight, But in Sauls hands and Ionathans were found, Chams hellish pollicy, most deu'lish sleight, To hold in Ignorance and Bondage bold, By taking way such helpes as Liberty propound."
22213,"As first, God by his Word and Spirit wrought, And fashion'd all things in this worlds Creation, So by this Word and Spirit he hath brought, All things to passe in this our renouation; And as he for our Bodyes preseruation, Hath here materiall Bread and Wine prepar'd, So's Word and Spirit is for sustentation Of all our Soules, that rightly it regard, Such neuer need of thirst and hunger be afeard."
22214,"As Appetite's a Signe of Body's Health, So of the Soules is hunger of his Word; And as to him that seeketh store of wealth, A Myne can best what he desires afford: So he that spirituall treasures vp would hoard, Come to this sacred Word where he shall find, It doth a world of mystery's record, The richest jewells to adorne the mind, True treasure's no where else reuealed to mankind."
22215,"For it's the Megazine where pastours haue, All gems and treasures to enrich their fold; The store-house, whence they all abundance craue Of liuing food, their Lambs in plight to hold; The armory, from whence they may he bold, To fetch all armes and weapons to withstand The wolues which them infest: and to vphold Truth and the right, against all Satans Band, Falfe Heretickes, base Lusts, and worlds encroaching hand."
22216,"But as the Manna that from Heau'n was sent, Bred Wormes, if wrong, but Food if rightly vsed, So breeds this Word our Soules due nourishment▪ But neuer-dying wormes if once abused: He that for Egypts Flesh-pots hath refused, This Heau'nly Food, And mans tradition vaine, His base false lying Legends rather chused, Shall whilst this Flesh betweene his jawes remaine, Be with his great and wealthiest chosen shauelings slain."
22217,Fountaine of liuing water!
22218,"which doth more And faster spring, as it is emptied, Most fruitfull Vine, which bringeth still more store, Of heau'nly grapes, as they are gathered."
22219,"Th' epistle of Heau'ns King, which rightly read, Brings vs the gladsome tidings of Saluation; Whose harder sense strong men may chuse as bread, The plainer babes may suck for sustentation; We both aright concort by heau'nly meditation."
22220,"The Sword that doth spiritually diuide From vs, all manner of concupiscence: Our youths reformer, and our ages guide, Transcending reason, more than reason sence; Truths ground, the Fountaine of Intelligence; Loues complement, the root of humblenesse; Faiths hold, the Rule of all Obedience: Hopes anchor, and the path of Rrighteousnesse, The ladder which we climbe from hence to Happinesse."
22221,Would you haue more?
22222,"it is the milke sincere, Which can alone quench Hells eternall fire; The only Daughter, to her Mother deare, The mystery which Angells doe admire, The sweetest song of blessed heau'nly Quire: Whose Praise eu'n all the heau'nly Powers sing; Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, all desire With all their might to strike this lofty string, Which Dauid in one Psalme a thousand times doth ring."
22223,"As Iacob with the Angell wrestled, Nor let him goe without a blessing would; So when words mysteries by vs are read, We striue and struggle for the meaning should: A goodly strife if we contending could Hold out, till what we seeke we doe obtaine; As Incense doth no pleasing smell vnfold, Nor Spice till it be in a Morter braine, So are words mysteries, till study makes them plaine."
22224,"This makes the lips of Christs endeared Bride, Than any Hony combe to drop more sweet; And vnderneath her daintiest tongue, abide Hony and Milke; The Hony is most meet To heale the wounds Sin makes from head to feet, The Milke for Babes; Loe thus her either Brest, Which like two twining Roes doe equall meet, Yeeld most abundant Food, if softly prest, And both with Roses sweet and Lilly's faire are drest."
22225,"This is the Tower of Dauid, which is built By th'holy Spirit, of most costly stone; Whereon a thousand Shields doe hang all guilt With swords and weapons for the mightiest One: This is the Priuie Garden, where alone The Spouse with Bridgroome doth her selfe delight, Planted with Nardus, Saffron, Cinamon, And all trees good for medicine, tast, or sight, Through which doth flow a well of liuing waters bright."
22226,Most heau'nly Paradise!
22227,"where tree of Life My Soule most heau'nly Fruits doth daily bring; Fit for the Lamb to walke in, with his wife, And for the Spouse most Angell-like to sing, The Soueraigne Grace and Bounty of her King; Where though I often seeke to hide in vaine, Mee from my Nakednesse discouering, My blessed Bridegroome calleth me againe, And clothes me with the Robes of Lamb most righteous slaine."
22228,"There Manna-like (Loe) eur'y Fruit doth tast, Iust as we would; none iustly can complaine; Though his vnweeded garden lieth wast, God send to good and bad alike his raine: Let him, where thornes and bryers doe remaine Take heed, how he this heau'nly deaw accuse; It is the root, thy euill heart and vaine, Which doth the sweetnesse of this raine abuse; Which for to water weeds and nettles doth it vse."
22229,How should this Word be sweet vnto the mouth?
22230,Wherein is nought but Gall and Bitternesse!
22231,"Or how should heau'nly deaws from West or South, Moisten that Heart, which by maliciousnesse More hardned is, than Flint in wickednesse: Alas what Corne can sweetest raine forth bring, In Ground that choked is with worldlinesse, Where as the thornes vp with the wheat doe spring, And from the root suck vp all heau'nly nourishing."
22232,"Ev'n as a Lamp, without supply of Oyle Being daily had, is soone extinguished; So though we seeme to prosper here awhile In Faith and Grace, all's soone abolished Vnlesse that they be daily nourished, With  In vaine it with our mouths is vttered, Except it in our hearts makes habitation; And we expresse it in our liues and conuersation."
22233,Oh let this holy Words most heau'nly Fire?
22234,"My secret, sound affections inflame, And burne vp all vaine fleshly worlds desire, Oh blessed Fire!"
22235,"like that in Bush did flame, But neuer did consume or burne the same; The fire whereby Gold Catholike is tride, And straw, and 'stubbled errour brought to shame, In whom this inward fire doth ay refide; He well the scorching heat of outward may abide."
22236,"But as no fleshly ey's can here behold, The glorious Sunne, but by that Suns sweet sight; So no man vnderstanding, may be bold To know this Word, but where it doth enlight."
22237,"Whereby I may my sinfull life amend; And in thy Statutes set my whole delight, And wholly in the way's of wisdome tend, So shall my foot stand fast, with ioy vnto the end."
22238,"For as the snow and raine from Heav'n descend, But neuer thither doe returne againe Till that be done; for which thou didst them send, To make the fruitfull soile fit for the graine; So neuer shall thy Word returne in vaine, But sure accomplish what thou dost intend; Then moisten daily, with this heav'nly raine My hardned Heart, that all my powers may bend, To glorifie thy name, who dost these showers send."
22239,"How should he feare to want his daily Food, Who with this Word of Life is nourished; Or who can thirst that drinketh of his bloud, Let not this Word be vnderualued: He that is with this Heau'nly Manna fed, Eates of the fattest of Gods spirituall store; Wherewith Christs tender Spouse is fostered, Till Shee growes strong, and faire to stand before Her Head, And neuer thirst nor hunger any more."
22240,"This Words Eternall, therefore hath no end; I no beginning, nor conclusion find."
22241,"I could herein my Life and Spirits spend, It doth so feed my Soule and glad my mind: But now my Muse to Prayer is assign'd, And bow's her knees to end her Meditation With Praise to Him, who first mine Heart inclin'd, To seeke this Heau'nly Food of Contemplation, I hope vnto his Glory, and mine owne Saluation."
22242,"AS wise experienc'd, valiant Generall, When's Souldier armed is from Foot to Head, And hath at hand his Shield, and Sword, and all His Armour, with his Belt fast buckled; Yet him into the Battell will not lead, Till he be taught his Sword aright to wield, To take Aduantages, if offered, And to defend his Body with his Sheild; Then him thus taught and train'd he leads into the Field."
22243,"So wee, that in these Spirituall Battells fight, Not with fraile Flesh, but Principality's; And powers of exceeding foce and might, Besides their treason, plots, and policies, Must first be taught in Armes to exercise; That all in complete Armour ordered And taught how to assault our enemy's, They with our Sword may be discomfited, And we from Hell and Bondage safe deliuered."
22244,"I of this Military Art doe know No Tutor like to holy supplication; Prayer who vse of all our Armes doth show, The Serieant Maior of our Militation: Diuinest Prayer, holy Meditation, Whereby with God we haue sweet conference About the mysteries of Mans Saluation; And call the Angells downe for our defence 'Gainst Flesh's, Worlds and Deuils hostile violence."
22245,"Prayer, who though her knees bow in the dust, Yet are her vpper parts aboue the sky; And doe into th' Almighty's presence thrust, To craue of all we want a new supply: Which like to clouds of incense vp doe flye, If offered by his Sonnes sweet mediation; Whose iust requests, no Father, can deny: Oh offer mine then, That this Meditation May be directed by thy Spirits illumination."
22246,"True Prayer is the opening the desire Ev'n of our Heart and Soule to God aright; Them powring out to him, that doth require We should lay open all before his sight: The Sacrifice wherein he doth delight, A sure defence to him that right doth pray; The Scourge, wherewith we Sin and Satan smite, And powers all and policies gainsay, Our surest Refuge in each dangerous Affray."
22247,"For Christian Souldier neuer kneeleth downe, And lifts his heart vp towards Heav'n to pray, But all his Foes spirituall, him arowne Assault and labour him herein to stay: Then is it time for him about to lay, With his sharp Sword to put them all to flight, And for to arme each part, lest they him slay, With Greaues, Belt, Brestplate, Shield and Helmet bright, In Faith, Hope, Patience, Truth and Righteousnesse to fight."
22248,"By rules of Art, I Prayer may diuide To these two Heads, Thankesgiuing, Inuocation; The second I in three doe subdiuide,  First seekes Gods Glory, and our owne Saluation; The second doth for others make petition, (So Christ doth intercede by mediation) By last we doe intreat for sins remission, And be deliuer'd from all ill, and superstition."
22249,"But as the Sauldier, be he ne're so strong; Well arm'd, and skil'd in points of Schoole-defence; If that his spirit faint, is laid along: So if we in our Armes haue confidence, And not relye on Gods sole Prouidence; His Spirit which helpeth our infirmities, And doth instruct to pray with reuerence, Sending vp heart and soule by sighs and cry's, For all our Armes and strength our Foes will vs surprise."
22250,"For Spirit is the cause efficient, Of all our prayers that to Heav'n ascend; Though Faith be the Internall instrument, By which we all things aske, doe apprehend: With Faith and Spirit, Prayer Heav'n doth rend, And whatsoeuer shee in Christ his name Doth aske, the Father downe to vs will send; This Pagans saw (though otherwise to blame) That Christians nothing beg, but they obtaine the same."
22251,"All Blessings spirituall, and temporall Publike and priuate, for our Selues and Friends; All that in this life, or a better fall To vs almighty God for Prayer sends: When Heau'n is shut vp, that no dew descends, If we forsake our sins, and pray for raine, The Heau'n on vs abundant showers spends: Though Foes vs captiue from our City's traine, Yet Prayer makes vs Free, and brings vs home againe."
22252,"If Dearth, Drowth, Pestilence be in the Land, Or City's be besieg'd by enemies, Then if the cause thereof, we vnderstand Our sins, And seeke by Prayer remedy, God will be mercifull accordingly: Yea if a Stranger, of an Heathen Nation, Doe call on God by Prayer heartily; And of his life doe seeke a reformation, His Prayer shall be heard, by Christ his mediation."
22253,"Thus Prayer is for all things profitable, If her true obiect she doe neuer misse; One God, who gracious, willing is and able, And of our Heart the only Searcher is: All things that are in Heau'n and Earth are his, We must, no person in the Deity, Omit, when as we pray to him for Blisse All workes externall, in the Trinity Are one, though their internall haue variety."
22254,Diuinest Pater-noster!
22255,"whose one Word, In it more heau'nly matter doth containe; Than one whole hour's babbling can afford, Suddaine abortiues of an idle braine: With tedious turnings, repetitions vaine, Out tumbling all that in their stomach lies, Which often goe beyond this Prayers straine, As if they were more feruent or more wise, Than he that for our patterne did it first deuise."
22256,"Pure Prayer made by serious meditation, Or by this holy patterne rightly pend; Briefe spirituall, sublime ejaculation, With feruent Fury doth to Heau'n ascend, And to the marke like swiftest arrow tend: God is in Heau'n, thou kneelest on the ground, To him therefore no rash petitions send; Therein let matter more than words abound, And inward sighs and groanes, than outward plaints and sound."
22257,"But Prayer; though by thy two mighty wings Of Loue, and Meeknesse, thou to Heau'n canst sore, And come in presence of the King of Kings, By pard'ning wrongs, and giuing to the poore; Presume not on thy merits ere the more That Brightnesse who doth sit vpon the Throne, Angells not able are to stand before; Alas how dar'st thou then there stand alone, Without the mediation of the Holy One."
22258,"Like birdlime merits, so thy wings besmeare, That thou not able art to take thy slight Aboue the Firmament, or to come neere That euershining Lamp of Heau'nly Light; Which ought thy Prayers to direct aright In Knowledge, Meeknesse, and Humility, By which we feele and haue and inward sight Of our vnworthinesse, and misery, And seeke else where, for worth and true felicity."
22259,"Eu'n to that liuely Fountaine of the Lamb, Which is a deepe well, wondrously profound, From which, by Prayer, breaking vp the dam, We draw vp waters which doe there abound: The depth of this rich Well, no Grace can sound, But feruent Prayer, when as Shee doth desire To coole her thirst, with waters therein found, wherewith if once we coole our thirst, like Fire The more we drinke thereof, the hotter's our desire."
22260,"An Oxes lowing, barking of a Dog, Grunting of Swine, doth more the Lord delight; Than Prayers which the World and Flesh so clog, They come not from vs with a Heart and Sprite, And as no salue or medicine hath might, To heale the wound which Iron doth containe: So Prayer neuer profiteth that wight, In whom Hypocrisie or guile remaine; For these still fester deeper to the Patients paine."
22261,"God is our Soules Physitian, and know's best What for her sicknesse is best remedy; And therfore when we needfull things request Of him, for this our lifes necessitie, He, better then his Patient, can descry What is most fit to keepe him from the graue, And cure him of his spirituall malady, Wherefore when we receiue not what we craue, We know Christ better know's, than we what need we haue."
22262,"Gods Word's the Sword, whereby our Lord doth sway And rules his Church here as he is a King; As Priest, he offers praises, and doth pray; As Prophet he glad tidings vs doth bring, Most wisely teaching and admonishing: Thus, Aaron-like, to God he doth present Our prayers, praises, tythes, and offering, (For Aarons Office Christs did represent) And makes them giue to God an acceptable sent."
22263,"We by her meanes all blessings here enioy, By prayer we obtaine here to be wise; By prayer with th' Almighty we aduise, By reading he doth answere vs againe; But our Lip-labour he doth all despise, Ah what doe then those simple people gaine?"
22264,Which in a tongue vnknowne doe mutter praiers vaine.
22265,"when the Spirit with vnderstanding pray's, And ev'n the Heart with sighs and groanes vp sends To him that willing, able is alway's Vs from Hell, Death and danger to defend: Then, as a Bullet doth the welkin rend, Blowne with the force of Powder and of Fire; So doe our Prayers vp to Heau'n ascend, By Zeale and Force of spirituall desire, Where they of God obtaine all things they can require."
22266,"Moses gain'st Amalec doth more preuaile By Prayer, and by holding vp his hands, Then mighty Iosuah, though he doth assaile Them with his strong and most selected bands: At Iosuahs short sweet Prayer the Sun still stands, Till hee's auenged of his enemy's; Elisha all the Host of God commands Him to relieue in his necessity's, Ev'n Fiery Horse and Charrets keep him where he lies."
22267,"Prayer is able by plaine strength to wring From hand-breadth Cloud, an Ocean of Raine; And Captiues out of Babylon to bring, To worship in Hierusalem againe."
22268,"The Angell striv'd with Iacob but in vaine; Without a Blessing he will not vnloose; Zenacharibs whole Host was spoyl'd and slaine, By Hezekias Prayer: when we close With God by Prayer, we our holds must neuer loose."
22269,"The Rains-horns, Trumpets, which seav'n Priests did blow, Most liuely doe strong Prayer represent; Which with the peoples shout did ouerthrow Proud walls of Iericho, to astonishment Of all the wicked, that therein are pent: This was the musick Aarons sonnes did sound With Trumpets, when to warre the people went; When Daniel in Lyons Den was found, True Prayer from their jawes him kept both safe and sound."
22270,"Tis not our words God lookes on, but the mind; Not to the place, but to the true intent In dungeon Ieremy did comfort find; And Iob vpon the dunghill takes content; Three Children in the fiery Fornace pent, Are heard, when Praises they to God doe sing: The Thiefe from Crosse as gratefull Prayers sent, As from his Temple Solomon the King, The Hermits Cell may oft as loud as Steeple ring."
22271,"Not that from publike Prayer I purloine, Of which Gods house hath her denomination; Where Priests and peoples hearts and voices ioyn, To teare the skies with cryes and supplication: Oh Force vnited of a Congregation!"
22272,"In Gods owne house of Prayer gathered, For Praise, Petition, or for Deprecation, God nought denyeth so petitioned, And wee thus from all euill are deliuered."
22273,"When Peter slept with chaines in prison bound, On each side Souldiers, Keepers at the doore, The Church doth pray, though hee sleepe fast and sound, And God him loosed from his chaines therefore: And when the Angell lighteth him before, The Iron Gate opes of his owne accord: Pauls, Dauids, Samuells, a thousand more Of Prayers, you may find vpon record, All which may seem to bind toth' Peace, our angry Lord."
22274,"I all conclude with his most heav'nly one, Who did in day's of his Humility; With  For Freedome of that dire calamity, Which came on him for our Iniquitie: And though he Legions could of Angells call, To saue him from inhumane cruelty, Yet Lamb-like did before his Shearer fall, Submitting to his Fathers will and pleasure all."
22275,"Without vs, God will nothing for vs doe, We therefore must prepare to fight alway; And without God we can nor stand nor goe, And therefore must be alwayes swift to pray: If these so pray'd when Foes did them assay, When Flesh and Bloud with Flesh and Bloud did fight; What shall we in this dangerous great affray, When we encounter with spirituall might, Which in his Agony did Christ our Head affright."
22276,"we at our first conuersion pray Most feruently oft, for the nouelty, But after negligent, cold sleeping say Our Pater-noster in security: Thou sleep'st secure, but ah!"
22277,"thine Enemy Doth watch thee thyn ev'n napping to surprise, We then to God withall our hearts doe cry, When as no thoughts withdraw vs otherwise; Alas!"
22278,but few or none pray often in this wise.
22279,"that a man of base and filthy mould, Should dare fall downe before Gods glorious Throne, His wants and imperfections to vnfold, And haue his heart like Nabals dead as stone; When Angells that come neere that holy One, Are faine their face to couer with their wings; So bright his Glorious Maiesty hath showne, Who is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; The searcher of our reines, and tryer of all things."
22280,"When I no longer able am to fight, Like Moses let me lift vp hands and pray Against the inuisible Amalekite, That spiritually doth seeke my soule to slay: When I with Faith, two words, Our Father, say; I pardon beg for Sin, Freedome from paine; Gods Heyre and Sonne, Christs Brother, I that day▪ Am made, and gifts of Holy Ghost doe gaine, Then let me neuer mumble ouer words in vaine."
22281,"But I confesse, though I doe often proue, There is no comfort like this one, to pray; That is bestow'd on man from Heav'n aboue, Yet find I Satan prest and busie ay, Mee in this holy duty to assay, By wandring Thoughts, and vaine imaginations, Which oft'doe lead my Mind so far astray, I am bereau'd of Heav'nly cogitations, And change for idle fancy's, holy meditations."
22282,"But Prayer doth so please my Muses straine, That I omitted haue of Praise to sing, The Sacrifice we offer here againe, For all the Bounty of our heav'nly King: I liken her to Prayers either wing, Forgiuing wrongs, and Almes vnto the poore Our holy liuely spirituall Offering, Of Body, Soule, Heart, Tongue, and all our store, With true Obedience to God for euermore."
22283,"Whilst here of Benefits no end we find, How should we euer make an end of praise; Oh happy Bands!"
22284,"that vs for euer bind, Ev'n when our Soules and Body's Chrisi shall raise, Our praise shall be eternall like our day's: He that his time in praise and hymnes would spend, I him referre to Dauids heav'nly Layes, Diuinely by the holy Spirit, pend, My Muse now out of Breath, cannot this Mount ascend."
22285,Oh let my voyce and heart together ioyne!
22286,"God of the lips accepts not, but the heart; Grant that my life in Holinesse may shine, That Conscience may euer beare apart; Presumptuous man!"
22287,"that darst thy Maker thwart, To poure out fond petitions base and vaine, When thou consid'rest before whom thou art, Him that doth all leud lying lips disdaine."
22288,And Hypocrites rewardeth with infernall paine.
22289,"If prayer be right, pure, sincere and meeke; It neuer empty shall returne againe; For God will either grant vs what we seeke, Or giue vs that shall be our greater gaine:  Ay in thine House of Prayer to abide; Where Swallow's build, and Sparrow's are full faine To lay their young ones by thine Altars side, Mee neuer let the Spirit of Prayer be deny'd!"
22290,"But since I ought to pray continually, How should my Pen of Prayer make an end; My Sauiour praying on the Crosse did dye; With Prayer Steuen his Soule to Heav'n did send, But I began with Prayer; let mee end With Praises to the Horne of my Saluation, Who sure I hope his blessed Spirit did send, To guide mee in this holy Meditation, Which fills my Tongue with Praise, & Heart with Admiration."
22291,"VRANIA, OR THE HEAVENLY MUSE."
22292,"LONDON, Printed by WILLIAM STANSBY."
22293,"TO MY EVER HONORED FRIEND, M. IOHN MAYNARD, one of the Gentlemen of his Maiesties Priuie Chamber in Ordinarie."
22294,"MY deare Vrania wilt thou now forsake My Cottage, and to Court thy selfe betake?"
22295,"Dost hope thou there, as here shalt find retire?"
22296,I cannot but thy simplenesse admire.
22297,"But since thou needs wilt goe, I'le thee commend vnto the Muses most familiar Friend; Who (had not his great Princes Loue and Grace Him brought from Muses Groues to's Royall place) Might on his Front haue worne thy Crowne of Bays, And beene the Prince of Poets in his dayes."
22298,"Hee'le leaue all profit, pleasure, honour gaine, The heav'nly Muse alone to entertaine; Oh happy Court!"
22299,"most blessed Courtiers yee, That from the Muses Springs transplanted bee, This 'tis makes Arts, and Learning so increase, Hence followeth all our happinesse and Peace: The Muses needs must dance when Courtiers sing, All follow the example of the King."
22300,Yours truly deuoted.
22301,"ABout the Season Lawyers tongues doe rest, And make for Haruest."
22302,"Ceres honour long vacation; I (freed from tumults which me erst opprest,) Dispose my mind to holy Meditation: And thinking how I might a subiect find, Delightfull, pleasing, sweet and profitable; My heart to better, and inrich my mind And tongue acquaint, with Phrases delectable."
22303,"As Traueller that meets with diuers wayes, I long deliberate to chuse the best And fairest Path to Mount, where Lawrell Bayes The Numbers crowne that are diuinely drest."
22304,"One while I sought in measures Comicall To maske the Graces all vpon the Stage; Or in a Tragique Scene vp Ghosts to call Of Worthys slaine by cruell Tyrants rage: Anon I would the Vnion celebrate, Which made a Damaske Rose of Red and White, The fairest Flower of Brittons happy State; Which Roses then, now Kingdomes doth vnite."
22305,"I thought likewise to sing that happy Peace Our Iland-world enioyeth by this Vnion, Which makes our honour, riches, strength increase, And haue with Heav'nly Arts such free communion."
22306,"Then I th'admired Prudence would rehearse Of Brittons Scepter-swaying Solomon, Matter which would immortalize a Verse, And saue such Splendour from obliuion: Prone was my flesh the winged wag to sing Of wanton Venus, and her Bitter-sweet, That glads the Tast, but doth the Bowells wring For chaster eares a Subiect far vnmeet."
22307,"Whilst wauering thus in fruitlesse inquisition, Yet vnresolv'd of any course I roue, Behold I see an heav'nly Apparition, Some Herauld doubtlesse from the Queene of Loue; Her gesture and her grace Angelicall, With wings whereby her selfe to heav'n shee reares, Her countenance faire, sweet, celestiall, Her voyce like Musicke of the heav'nly Spheares."
22308,"A glorious Garland crown'd her golden head, Bedeck'd with all the Flowers, sweet, and gay, That could on Tempes Plaines be gathered, By learned Sisters in their fairest May."
22309,"Immortall Flowers, which spring and flourish ay, And ay their verdure and sweet sent retaine, Like heav'nly Arts, which neuer doe decay, But by their vsing greater glory gaine."
22310,"On shoulders hangs her azure mantle light, With siluer spangles all adorned faire, Twinkling like brightest Starres in frosty night, As they are moued by the gentle aire: Her nether parts to hide from vulgar eye A Kirtle like Heav'n Conopy did couer; Where all the Signes of Heav'n embroidred fly, And all the Graces seeme about to houer."
22311,"I, saith shee, am Vrania to thee sent, From thine adored Mistresse, Queene of Loue; I rauish Soules aboue the Firmament, That they in Numbers like the Spheres may moue."
22312,"With Siluer Key I doe vnlocke the mind Of Mortalls sealed vp in Ignorance, That oft their Soules aboue the Stars they find, When Bodyes lye on ground as in atrance."
22313,"For I the Spirit am of Contemplation, Th' Ehxir of Ambrosia diuine, Pure Angells food, Soules sweetest delectation, The Helicon, where both the Sisters nine."
22314,"Art teacheth Art, Experience Policy, And Practice guild's the tongue with Eloquence; But none reach lofty straines of Poesie, That haue them not by heav'nly insluence."
22315,"Hence 'tis that Clerks which gaine immortall praise, By their deepe learned Eloquence in Prose, Their numbers cannot to such honour raise, As one that scarce the Rules of Grammer knows: It is beyond the reach of will or wit, A holy Flame of heav'nly Loues pure fire, A soaring, high, transcendent, furious fit, Whose Life, light, heate, and strength loue doth inspire."
22316,"Loue's her Beginning, and her End is Loue, Loue is the Soule, and Life of Poesie; No Poeme without Loue did euer proue, No more then Musicke without Harmony."
22317,"The Loue of Honour, and of Cheualry, So rais'd the old blind Greeks Heroique quill; Homer."
22318,"Hee lifts Achilles valiant acts more high, Than his that conquer'd all the world at will."
22319,"The loue of Ciuill, and Self-gouernment Him taught to frame such an exact Ulisses; That hee who by this Patterne did inuent, Roomes glorious author, such perfection misses."
22320,"Eglogues of Loue are Muses first delights, Till thorough country pleasures shee doth come, To sing in state of Honour, Armes, and Knights, And out of old Troys ashes raise vp Rome."
22321,"The wanton, all whose speeches were in Verse, Who sings in Fictions all Dame natures story; Ouid."
22322,"In ev'ry sentence doth his Loue rehearse, But ah base Lust obscureth all his glory."
22323,"So Loues old rigid Cato vertues lore, He makes them dance the measures cunningly; To loues Lucretius Dame natures store, Hee turnes all Pliny into Poetry."
22324,"And as the obiect of our Loue exceeds, So strikes the Muse on high or lower strings; Who lowly late did maske in Shepheards weeds, In high Heroiques of Armes, and Honour sings."
22325,"My Darling Bartas, who on Angells wings; Beholds the Six Day's of the Worlds Creation, Was so in loue with Heav'n and heauenly things, Hee wholly on them fixt his Contemplation."
22326,"And wen he on the Seuenth Day comes to rest, He them all orders to his Makers Glory: Doubtlesse he fram'd a new world in his brest, Whereof he so Diuinely sings the story."
22327,"It was this heav'nly Loue that did incite, The warlike Shepheard such sweet notes to sing, Dauid."
22328,"His loue vnto Gods Statutes day and night, Doe strike so loud his Harpe and Violls string."
22329,"And as Wind-Instrument to him repay's That sounds it sweetest, musicke, for his breath; So sings this Psalmist Hymnes, and Heav'nly Lay's To him that giues him Spirit, till his Death."
22330,"Oh heav'nly Musicke, which, the rage could quell Of Cis his sonne, possest with euill Spirit Pure Hymns from God, sweet mercy to compell, When foulest Sins Hell-fire doe commerit."
22331,"Sweet Shepheard, when thou singest forth thy Flocks, The Angells all admire thy heav'nly Lay's; Thy musicke moues, stones, trees, and senslesse stocks, When thou diuin'st of Christs most happy day's."
22332,"Yet those hands that so gently touch a string, Can Lyons, Beares, and Wolues in peeces teare; And quell the proud Philistine with a sling, From whom the Host of Israel runs for feare."
22333,"Loue at his birth him dandled in her Lap, Whilst all the Graces Lullaby's doe sing; Shee fed him with Ambrosia for Pap, And rais'd him from a Shepheard to a King."
22334,"And thou my Sonne, although thy Breath be faint; I cannot but commend thy good desire, With their diuine Essays thy Muse acquaint; Which may be fewell to thy heav'nly fire."
22335,"Yet though thou straine Inuention, Art, and wits, And fills thy Verses with thy wisest Says, They shall not liue, except some holy fits, Thy Soule aboue the Heav'ns bright Tapers raise."
22336,"Thy Soule whose Beeing is Celestiall fire, Must like the Saints be rapt vp in a trance; And extased with holiest desire, If thou thy Verse wouldst vp to Heav'n aduance."
22337,"For as none but the Spirit of a man, The secrets of that Spirit can disclose; So none attaine sublimest numbers can, Except a holy Fury them compose."
22338,"And as no Actor well can play the King, That is not one in his imagination: So none can Vertues pure Ideas sing, That suits his mind not to his meditation."
22339,"Poets are like to Organs sounding shrill With fingers touch, so long as they be full: But as on empty ones; in vaine's our skill, Ev'n so are Verses, without Fury, dull."
22340,"And as none on the Harpe sweet tunes can sound, Till hee by Art hath set in Tune each string; So none high-rapted numbers can compound, Till's soule be tun'd by spheare-like rauishing."
22341,"Sith then to Numbers life from Heav'n is sent, Oh rarest Spirits!"
22342,"how dare you abuse Them, to dishonour him, who hath them lent To's Glory, and your Chast delight to vse?"
22343,"Shall your diuinest spirits stoupe so low, To make your-selues base slaues to Lust and Sin; And let your pure Pyrenean Fountaines flow In stinking Channells all defil'd within."
22344,"Still will you fawne on Fooles, and Greatnesse flatter?"
22345,And fill the world with wanton idle groanes?
22346,"Still shall your Muse like Pyes this one song chatter, Of Lust, which brings corruption to the bones?"
22347,"Ist not enough you burne in lustfull flame, Except you eke corrupt youth prone to vice?"
22348,"And strumpet-like hang out your signes of shame, The Passengers to folly to intice?"
22349,"For numbers, notes, and tunes such power haue, They soonest on the noblest Spirits seaze; Whereon they doe their formes and sounds engraue; As Seales on wax imprinted are with ease."
22350,"And that's the Reason, graue and wiser Sages, Haue banish't from their coasts lasciuious rymes, When Poets chast and vertuous in all ages, Haue beene as Priests and Prophets in their times."
22351,"Would you the Genius of your Fury raise, And change your fleshly to spirituall Flame, Such matter would immortalize your praise And leaue behind you a most honour'd name."
22352,"Your Verse would be admir'd, you honoured As Secretarys to the King of Kings, For first the Prophets words thus numbered, To handle mystery's and holy things."
22353,"Thus Dauid all his Psalmes by measure sings, Moses the freedome from Egyptian thrall, And Miriam vpon a Timbrell rings Gods Praises; Iudith the Assirians fall."
22354,"They sang for Ioy, but Iob, and Ieremy Sing, when they with afflictions most are prest; A Nunc Dimittis was the Poefie The Swan-like Simeon warbled in his brest: Magnificat the blessed Virgin sings; The Angells, Glory sing to God on high: And Martyrs, bound to stakes with Iron strings Sing Praises whilst in Flames their Body's fry▪ So burnes their zealous heate of Loues purefire, They feele no outward for the inward flame: So long as they haue Bowells to respire They neuer cease to praise Gods holy name: But he that seemes an Angell of the light, More easie children of the light 'tabuse, In Verse doth also his delusions write, And for his Oracles did numbers chuse: And for he know's that Loues pure heav'nly fire, Is that by which we Gods whole Law fulfill; His Prophets all must chant of Lusts desire, And make great Ioue be rul'd by Cupids will."
22355,"Thus bloud corrupt th'inchanter doth instill With lustfull Fire to scal'd youths hotter veines; And poisons with this Copperis the quill Of Heathen Poets, in their gentle straines."
22356,"Who to make more authenticke Ribauldry, Doe faigne their Gods therein to take delight, Where though they Natures secrets wittily Oft vaile!"
22357,yet thus to Lust they youth inuite.
22358,"I know in first pure streames of Poesie, The Muses Bath was chast as Pheebes shrine, The Virgin Graces, Ioues chast progeny, And Pallas chast, and vertuous, as diuine."
22359,"Venus was then with Almas title graced, And lov'd her Spouse plaine Vultan, Mars scarce knew: Whom though shee oft in nuptiall bed imbraced, Twas not for wanton pleasure but for due."
22360,"This Poetry, my Sonnes, reuiv'd againe, To mortalls would restore the golden times, And for your Brow's immortall Lawrells gaine, And to their ancient honour raise your Rimes."
22361,"But Satan since another patterne set, Which he would haue all his to imitate; And like a Fowler draweth to his Net Poore Birds with merry notes and pleasing Bait."
22362,"But thou that seek'st Gods Glory, not thine owne, And striv'st to quench, not quicken lustfull Flame; Chuse these diuine ensamples I haue showne, And guild not with faire words the foulest shame."
22363,"When thou do'st feele Loue's Fury in thy breast, What better theame or matter canst thou take; Than sing his Loue who Heav'n and Earth possest, Yet here himselfe for Loue a Slaue did make."
22364,"The Loue betweene the Bridgroome and his Deare, Were matter to immortalize a Song: No Man or Angell euer yet did heare Diuiner Musicke from a mortall tongue."
22365,"This is a deepe, broad, boundlesse Ocean; A high Pernassus of sweet Meditation; No holy Fury diue the bottome can, Nor reach the height thereofby contemplation."
22366,"Soule-rapting Tunes: when Turtles voyce doth sound The Songs of Sion, in a Holy Land."
22367,"Sweet accents, making Hills and Mountaines bound, And Cedars of the Forrest trembling stand."
22368,This better will thy heart; enrich thy mind; Here profit thou shalt reape with sweet delight.
22369,"Here thou refreshing Nectar-streames shalt find, To coole thy thirst, and cleare thy dimmer sight."
22370,"For thus thou safely maist enioy delight, The pleasure which shall last for euermore; Vaine Worldly Pleasures leaue men ere their night, But when the iudgement comes, they run before."
22371,"These heav'nly precepts sweetned by her voyce, So rauished my Soule with delectation: My Muse at quiet since doth sole reioyce, And take delight in heav'nly contemplation."
22372,"And though I neuer hope to touch with hand, Much lesse my head with Lawrell Bough adorne, May I yet mine owne Passions thus command My Cost and Tilt's short of my Crop of Corne."
22373,"The Authors Vow or wish, at the Consecration of a Chap∣pell newly founded by the Right Ho∣norable WILLIAM Lord Maynard, at his House in Eston in Essex."
22374,"LEt others heape vp Titles, Lands, and store, Their names on earth, for euer to maintaine!"
22375,"Thou to thy house dost surer honour gaine, By adding of this Consecrated Floore: Where Thou and Thine may euer him adore That Proud throw's downe, and Humble men doth raise, Thy Father built the Palace in his day's, But leaues Gods house vnto his prudent Sonne; Who Numa-like now plants Religion, Where Romulus the first Foundation lay's."
22376,"This Leauen makes the whole Lump to endure, Shis Salt to Thee and Thine shall season all, And gainst thy Foes shall be a Brasen Wall: This shall Thee waking keepe most safe and sure, And nigh this Altar thou shalt sleepe secure: By this Thy Honour ay continue shall, And Blessed make Thy Names memoriall: (Alas!"
22377,"this worlds vaine, seeming, glittring Glory Is  What's built on this Foundation cannot fall."
22378,"So long as Sions Temple's vndefil'd, The line of Dauid doth the Scepter sway; But suddenly are captiue led away, When Altars they with Idols had defil'd; Wherefore they wise did Gods house rebuild, When out of Babylon they were translated: Then since Thou wisely has determinated Thine House and Honour by Gods Church to raise; Hee Blissings send, so long as You him praise, So may both stand for ay vnruinated!"

22382,"Oh may this fire within these walls indure, So long as Neptunes waues this Ile immure: And as from Mountaines comes that wholesome breath, Which healthfull makes the Valleys all beneath: So from this Bi∣shop Mon∣taigne MONTAIGNE health come and saluation, Vnto the Founder, and his generation: Let Prophets, Priests, in Prayers all combine To make this House a Blisse to Thee and Thine: And when by their deuotions ioy'nd, this flame Is kindled; let thy Priests maintaine the same And offer vp thy prayers day and night, Like fumes of Incense, in th' Almighties sight; Oh force vnited, of a Congregation That ioyne in prayer at a Consecration; With these my Muse (now thine) shall beare a part, And whilst they pray by booke, shee'le pray by hart."

22439,"SOme loathing Peace, wish Warre, because vn∣knowne, To them Peace is like Manna, common growne: I such doe wish to trauell out, and see Their Countries Blisse, by others misery."
22440,"Peace types vs out the Blisse of our Creation, Warres shew our fall from Glory to damnation: All Warriours since, which seeke immortall fame, Must fight for PEACE, or merit Hell and shame."
22441,"Sweet PEACE to Subiects doth all blessings bring, Immortall honour to a mortall King; The Uertues foure, which doe on Peace attend, Her Body guard, as still doth them defend: For nothing sets a Kingdomes Peace so fast, As Courtiers constant, courteous, graue & chaste."
22442,"TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, IOHN, LORD BISHOP of Lincoln, Lord Keeper of the Great Seale, and one of his MAIESTIES most Honorable Priuy Councell."
22443,"THou great Peace-Keeper, whom the greatest King, That our great God of Peace did euer bring To rule these Westerne Iles, in happy Peace, For Honours, Arts, and Piety's increase, Thou, whom this mighty Monarch doth intrust With his Great Seale, as Prudent, Faithfull, Iust; God to thy outward blisse, adde inward Peace, That Goodnes with thy Greatnesse may increase."
22444,"May but thine actiue Spirit now descend Frō high affaires, and high-straind thoughts vnbend, To walke in Muses gardens delicate; Wisest Apollo thou shalt imitate, And Martiall Pallas, whom the Poets faine To leaue Olympus Mount for Tempe-plaine: Thus Dauid leaues his Throne, to sit with Graces, The Preacher after Trauels, Hymen paces."
22445,"These Precedents imboldned haue my Muse, For Patron of the Graces, thee to chuse, Whom great Augustus with his Seale doth grace; Oh be a true Mecenas in thy place: Seale vp for euer Ianus Temple doore, And let Bellona's voice be heard no more: I of some Graces onely meditate, But they are all in thee habituate; Then my defects excuse; when we oppose Darknesse to Light; the day more glorious showes."
22446,"Your Lordships humble seruant, Robert Aylet."
22447,To the curious READER.
22448,"PRophaner Michols will be censuring Eu'n Dauid, if hee doe but dance and sing Before the Arke: Then how should holy Rimes Escape the Iawes of these Censorious times?"
22449,MEDITATION I. Of Peace and Concord.
22450,"WHen first Worlds great Creatour fashioned This little Mansion for our Soules of Clay; Man in his image he so ordered, He had both Will and Power to obay: Thus this sweet concord might haue lasted ay, If to his Power, had been ioynd his Will, Which failing in Obedience to stay, He brake the Peace, whereby he all did fill With Fury, Warres and Strifes, which doe continue still."
22451,"Thus, by mans wilfull fault, Hostility Betweene him and his Maker first began, Such breach hath Sinne made with the Deity, As reconcile, not all the creatures can: Besides, they all are Foes become to man, For that he 'gainst their Maker did rebell: Poore Adam, guilty, naked, wo and wan, The Noise of God to couert doth compell: A guilty Conscience is more terrible than hell."
22452,"Adam eu'n then did feele a double paine, One paine of Losse, another paine of Sense, And now against him Battailes all maintaine,  and Conscience, Are out with him for Disobedience: Till God, who first elected Man in Loue, For mercies sake, now by Obedience, From him doth paine of Losse, and Sense remoue, And brings to endlesse Peace, and rest, in heau'n aboue."
22453,"Of wondrous value is this Pearle of Peace, Which to redeeme, the Lord of Life was sold, Most sweet peace-offring; when for our release Christs precious bloud was as a ransome told."
22454,"Not that we heere should Peace and quarter hold With Hell, World, Lust, true Peace's mortall foes: Such Peace doth vs in dang'rous warres infold: Except we these most valiantly oppose, For seeming Peace on earth, we doe the heau'nly lose."
22455,"Therefore the great Peace-maker did not come To send vs Peace on earth, but Swords and Strife; Debate betwixt the Father and the Sonne, Mother and Daughter, Husband and the Wife: Perpetuall warfare is a Christians life, With Armes and Weapons, he must fortifie Against his foes, which will assaile him rife: Right end of Warres and all hostility, Is gaine of happy Peace, and sweet tranquillity."
22456,"Thou, that before, through warres and dread affray, Hast for vs enter'd on true Peace and rest, By thine owne bloudy wounds vs op'ning way, And paines, wherewith thy foes did thee infest; Inspire sweet heau'nly peace into my brest, That thence, as from a Lymbick may distill Sweet drops of peace, on hearts that are opprest, And with true loue of heau'nly peace so fill, As feeling her sweet Good, they neuer faint for ill."
22457,"Peace may be call'd the minds serenity, The concord of th' affections and the will, The  The Soules chiefe good, the conscience free from ill; Thus is she simply: but if so you will Discerne her nature plainer; we diuide Her by the friends, to whom she beares good-will, Thus we in Peace with God doe first abide, Next, with our selues, and, last with all the world beside."
22458,"And yet this peace with God, our selues, and men, Is but one, and the same true heau'nly peace: That happy peace, we haue with God, is when We freed by Faith, are iustifide of Grace: True inward peace then in our hearts hath place, When as our Consciences excuse within: Then peace with men we rightly doe embrace, When to haue peace with all men we begin: Thus haue we peace with Iewes, and Turkes, but hate their sinne."
22459,"Eternall, inward, and externall peace, Eternall Peace is that with God alone, From which our inward Life hath and increase, The third's the peace we haue with eu'ry one; No farther yet than it concernes our owne: For when we wrong'd or iniuride behold Those, that with vs in godly League are growne."
22460,"We breake our League, if peace with them we hold, For by such worldly peace our loue to God growes cold."
22461,"God is the Author, Christ the King of Peace, The Seeds of peace, are by the Spirit sowne, Which, water'd by his Seruants heere, increase Till they into abundant fruits are growne."
22462,"How beautifull the feet of them doe showne, That Peace's ioyfull tidings to vs bring!"
22463,"This Pearle of Peace, where euer it is knowne, Doth passe all vnderstanding; Christ our King Did honour Peace on earth with his sweet publishing."
22464,"Health, Quiet, Happinesse, Prosperitie, All Concord, Liberty and good successe, Peace to vs brings with minds-tranquillity, And frees our Soules from dismall heauinesse: It is the doore to inward happinesse, True inward Peace our hearts doth mollifie, And make like Wax, that Ioy on them may presse The priuy Seale; whereby, assuredly, We sealed are to liue with God eternally."
22465,"The Gentiles that farre off, and strangers were, Peace by Christs precious bloud now maketh nic: For he's our peace whereby all one we are."
22466,"For so all fulnesse of Diuinity Inhabited in's Body really; That on the Crosse by his most precious blood, He all in heau'n and earth did pacifie: Abysse profound, not to be vnderstood, But where sweet inward Peace of Conscience makes it good."
22467,"For in the heart and Conscience is the Seat Of all the Peace, that mortals can befall: Alas!"
22468,"what bootes it, though our peace seeme great Abroad, if that within we nourish shall Hate Diffidence, Contentions, Enuy, Gall, Without this inward peace and holinesse?"
22469,"We may not hope to see the Lord at all, Peace-makers onely shall haue happinesse."
22470,True peace on earth the earnest is of heau'nly Blesse.
22471,Sweet voyce of peace!
22472,"than which, we nothing heare In heau'n or earth more glad and acceptable!"
22473,What more delightfull can to vs appeare?
22474,"What here than to possesse, more profitable?"
22475,"As sprite of man to quicken is not able The members, without peace and vnity; So neuer stand the Churches members stable, Vnlesse sweet inward peace them viuifie, And cause them all to liue in peace and amitie."
22476,"Inseparable friends are Righteousnesse And peace, they one another meet and kisse: Except thou Iustice loue, thou do'st professe In vaine thy loue to peace: Him that doth misse True loue to Iustice, peace will neuer blisse: What more than Peace do all mankind admire?"
22477,"But Righteousnesie to them a stranger is: Sweet Fruits of Peace all earnestly require, But to the workes of Iustice no man hath desire."
22478,"With peace are alwayes Mercy, Grace, and Loue, Faith, Meeknesse, Humblenesse, Ioy, Holinesse, Except these Graces her companions proue, She's but seeming-quiet Lazinesse, Eu'n stupifide with worldly happinesse: Like dreames and slumbers, in a morning faire, Which feed our Fantasies with seeming blesse, But when we wake, lo, nothing but the ayre, Our golden hopes are flowne, we left in more Despaire."
22479,"This is a seeming peace: there is a feign'd, Which wolues do in sheeps clothing oft propound: Ah!"
22480,"many Soules by such false peace are train'd, To build their peace vpon vncertaine ground."
22481,"Such semblance make, as if there did abound With them, Ioy, Peace, Truth, and Sinceritie; But seeke, and nothing lesse with them is found, Vaine outward glory, wealth, prosperitie, Is all their ayme and end, not minds Tranquillitie."
22482,"Curst be their Vnion, cursed is their peace: For by their concord, plots, and vnity, True Iustice hindred is, in her increase, For thus they foster all iniquity."
22483,"These make a shew of peace, but come to try Them by their actions, they are instruments Of  Like Simeon, Leui, cou'ring their intents, With making Proselites, and sewing Churches rents."
22484,"Foure mortall enemies there are to peace, Base auarice, pale enuie, wrath, and pride: If from vs we for euer banish these, We may in happy peace for ay abide: These two words, Mine and Thine, do more diuide The minds of brethren, neighbors, priests and flocke, Than all that you can reckon me beside: These two the bands of Amity vnlocke, And all the world together in a fury shocke."
22485,"Eu'n as mans body, whose iust temp'rature Consists of humid, frigid, hot and dry; So long as they in Concord do indure, Doth thriue and grow: but if ambitiously They striue amongst themselues for soueraignty, Their ciuill breach doth cause Deaths execution."
22486,"So is't in City, Church, or Family, Sweet Peace and Concord breed sound constitution: But Enuy, Discord, Pride, a fearefull dissolution."
22487,"And as in Musicke diuers diffring Sounds, By Concord make one pleasant Harmonie, But he that straines aboue the rest, confounds His owne, and all the others melody: So it befalleth each Society, So long as they in Concord do remaine, They liue in plenty, ease, prosperity: But if they iarre for Enuy, Pride, or Gaine, They from their quiet state do tumble downe amaine."
22488,"As many weake stickes, in one faggot bound, No strength of man e're able is to breake, Which if they be alone and single found, Would seeme but easie to a man that's weake; The same we may of Peace and Concord speake, Whilst they true Subiects hearts in one do bind, No forraine Powre on them their spite can wreak, But if with iarres it them disioyn'd doth find, It breakes their rankes, them chasing like a fearefull Hind."
22489,"Concord and Peace be like a brazen wall, No Fort's so strong as vertuous minds combin'd: But as a straight and crooked piece, by all The workmans skill, cannot in one be ioyn'd: So fores it with a good and wicked mind; In wicked nature fraught with guile and spight, True Peace and Concord thou shalt neuer find: For as good minds great pleasure take in right, So base malicious hearts, in doing wrong, delight."
22490,"The hungry Foxe, pursuing hard his prey, By chance vpon a sleeping Snake doth tread; For which, she wroth, deferres not long his pay, But with sting taught him to take better heed: Thus dang'rously both wounded are indeed, And both to wounds do Phisicks helpe apply, Which inwardly do ranckle more than bleed, Yet both by Leeches skill and Surgery: For bodies griefe, not minds, do find a remedy."
22491,"Many yeeres after, this malicious Snake, Who still reuenge doth harbour in her brest, Meeting the Foxe, him fairely thus bespake: Ah!"
22492,"how great sorrow doth my heart molest, That we should one another thus infest: For since the time that first began our broyle, No greater care within mine heart doth rest, But how our loues againe to reconcile, (Thus would malicious Snake the crafty Foxe beguile.)"
22493,"Now if you please, let vs all iniuries Forget, and as we ought true Peace embrace: For Peace and Concord all good things supplies To mortals, of what-euer ranke or place: What thing more pleasing, sweet and good than Grace?"
22494,"She all conserues, keepes all things safe and sound, Makes great increase of Fruit in little space, In pleasure, wealth and ease she doth abound, Yea all the good, that one can wish, in her is found."
22495,"She is the cherisher and nurse of Life, She breeds, feeds, nourisheth, giues education, When all confounded are by warres and strife, Which breeds Corruption: Peace brings Generation."
22496,Nothing on earth is of like estimation.
22497,"Thus hauing said, she offers him to kisse, And faire embrace, according to her fashion: But Renold trusts her ne'r the more for this, Who most malicious, cruell, implacable is: But thus replies, All's true that thou hast said: But as true peace of all things is the best, So sure of nothing more am I afraid Than feigned peace: a poyson nearly drest, Which thou concealst now boyling in thy brest; And, with a seeming Kindnesse, cruelly Wouldst spill my Life, when as I fear'd it least: No open sorce, spite, or hostilitie, So dang'rous is, as feigned peace and amity."
22498,"This  All ouerthrowes, when most we seeme secure: No man will trust an open enemy, And therefore 'gainst his malice stands more sure; When he by fraud can him no harme procure: But such faire painting words, and honest showes, Insnare the simple inexpert and pure, And into misery and errour throwes, Then he too late plaine-dealing from dissembling knowes."
22499,"But now to thee, that peace dost so commend: I answer, That for reconciliation, And thee imbracing as a faithfull friend, I neuer had so fond determination: God shield me from thy sly malicious nation?"
22500,"Thy guilefull heart's as hollow as the sand; Thou doubt'st of Truth, I of Equiuocation: Stand off: The Morall you may vnderstand, You haue this Tale from me, but at the second hand."
22501,"Thus did the Snake our mother Eue beguile By baits of honour, kindnesse, and ambition: But from her stole this pearle of peace the while, And plung'd her, and her Seed in all perdition: E're since by feign'd shewes, & false apparition, This subtill Serpents viprous progeny, Imbrace vs, Ioab▪ like, with all submission, But to the heart-blood stab vs priuily."
22502,Ile neuer trust a base malicious enemy.
22503,"Of a fat Iouiall Oratour I read A pleasant story; who when he ascends Into a narrow Deske for Peace to plead, The people all foorth shouts and laughters sends: Though's corps were grosse, his wit soone apprehends Th'occasion, and he thus them telleth plaine, My wife at home in bignesse me transcends, Yet vs at peace, one bed can well containe, At oddes, we in this Citty wals cannot remaine."
22504,"But well my Muse of her Digression wites From Peace to Concord; which the Schooles define, An vnion of diuers appetites  To Peace, this Definition they assigne, To be a concord in the appetite,  In one: I Peace and Concord here vnite, And of them, as but one true perfect peace do write."
22505,"All cruell warres and battels Dauid fought, Was but to stablish peace to Solomon; That type of happy peace, who now (no doubt) Rests in that Peace, which he on Earth begun: Oh blessed, ioyfull, happy Vnion, The Song of peace thou singest of the Bride, And that great King of peace, her louely One; When sitting at the Banquet by his side, Her with true peace as with a Banner he doth hide."
22506,"His sweetest gardens are our beds of rest, The fruits there growing, sweetest fruits of peace, The tunes which birds there warble in their brest, Be songs of Peace: There Spring doth neuer cease, But Zephyrus with Dewes blowes full increase."
22507,"which makes the Turtles voice resound Such Musique, as the heauiest heart can ease, For she her notes doth to the heart propound, But none conceiue the sweetnesse, till they feele the sound."
22508,"If I through Scriptures gardens should you lead, And shew you all that glorious Nurcerie Of fruits and flowres there, of Peace that breed: I should you tire with sweet Variety."
22509,"It was the last bequest and Legacie, Our King of peace did his Apostles leaue: Who made our peace when he on Crosse did die."
22510,"For Peace, he barres and gates of hell doth cleaue, And his Will in due time to endlesse peace receiue, See his Apostles, Martyrs, Fathers all, How meeke and lowly they on peace attend, Refusing neither Crosse, nor cup of Gall, So as they might attaine vnto their end; Sweet peace on earth they labour to defend, When they haue made their peace in heau'n aboue: Who feeles this inward Peace, feares not to spend Wealth, Strength, and Life, for to maintaine the loue Of those, which with them members of one Body proue, But what need I thee furnish from without, If in thine heart this inward peace thou find?"
22511,"This peace of Conscience will giue (no doubt) More Rest and Comfort to thy Soule and Mind, Than all wealth, pleasure, glory here assign'd Vnto the wicked, for their worldly rest."
22512,Sweet peace of Conscience!
22513,"who art not consin'd To any pleasure here, on earth possest, Eternall, heau'nly peace possesseth all thy brest."
22514,"Oh I had my Muse some losty rapted straine, The glory of this heau'nly peace to sing, Which doth the heau'n, earth, sea, ayre, all maintaine, By gentle gouernement and ordering: Or were she able, on a high-strain'd string, To sing the Honour of my Soueraigne, That grand Peace-maker, Britaines peacefull King, Who through the Christian world doth Peace maintaine: God grant, for peace on earth, thou heau'nly peace mayst gaine."
22515,"how can my soule opprest with Care, And worldly tumults, of such Glory sing, Since quiet peace her selfe remoueth farre From Discord, Strife, Contentions, Quarrelling?"
22516,"Oh let me vnder shadow of thy wing, In happy rest and Peace for ay abide!"
22517,"So shall I neuer feare the malicing Of Enuy, Satan, Couetize, or Pride: True inward peace was neuer vanquished, though tride."
22518,"Ah thus I wish for Peace, but worldly Care And troubles more and more my mind oppresse; Afflictions heere and Crosses should prepare, And fit a man for peace and happinesse, But oft they fill vs more with worldlinesse; Yet such the nature is of inward peace, She fils the hearts of all, that her possesse, And euer as her vigour doth increase, Our worldly thoughts and cares do more and more decease; O King of Peace!"
22519,"grant me this inward peace, 'Tis that for which the Spirit alwayes prays, That peace which brings all Graces sweet increase, And now thou art to heau'n gone, with vs stays."
22520,"This Peace, Hell, Death, nor Tyrants rage dismays, 'Tis not such peace as world to vs doth giue, In Comforts she transeends Sunnes gentlest rays, By her when we in Life of Grace haue thriue, With her we euer shall in life of Glory liue."
22521,"This is the peace which sets our hearts as sure As Sions Mount, which no force can remoue, This peace it is which euer shall endure, If rooted in our hearts by Faith and Loue: This Peace which first descends from heau'n aboue, And doth our troubled Consciences still, Which makes the Members like the Head to proue, This is the Peace of God, the which doth fill Both heau'n and earth with Peace, and all men with good will."
22522,"Now neuer let my Soule enioy true Peace, If now she doth not more my heart delight, Than all the pleasures, glory, wealth and ease, Which heere mens minds to vanity inuite: God of all Peace, which hast me giu'n a sight Of this most rich inualewable treasure, Grant, I on peace may set my whole delight, True peace like loue, which hath no bounds nor measure, In this I ly downe safe, and take my rest and pleasure."
22523,"THe heau'nly Steeres-man, which was erst my guide Vnto the hau'n of peace and happy rest, Where I could wish at anchor ay to ride, Free from worlds stormes, which mortals heere molest; Doth now vnto my whiter Muse suggest, The praise of heau'nly Chastitie to sing, Most needfull grace for those, in peace, that rest: For when she most tranquillity doth bring, Man most in danger is of Lusts enchanting sting."
22524,"For such is Hels malicious subtilty, With all aduantages still to assaile The part vnarm'd of mans mortalitie, That he with greater danger may preuaile: And when we all his instruments do quaile Of Anger, Enuy, Couetize, and Pride: In humble quiet peace, he will not faile, By slight, within our wils with brands to slide, Where with he fires the gates, and all the Towne beside."
22525,"Thus when as Ioab and the host were prest To lye in Tents, and Fields a warfaring, And Ishai's sonne in Peace at home doth rest, Diuinest Hymnes and Layes on Harpe to sing; Malicious Basiliske with lustfull sting Enflames his eyes, which set his heart on fire, And from his heau'nly peace to warre doth bring, Such lustfull warres, such raging hot desire, As breed him dismall broiles and Gods reuenging ire."
22526,"For mans whole life is a continuall warre With Satan, World, his fleshes sinne and Lust: Satan the Captaine, these his Souldiers are, Against these alwayes stand in armes we must: But most of all, when we in peace doe trust, We want Dame Chastity's commanding Power, Sweet holy Lady, faithfull, pure and iust, In peace and rest our safe defence and tower, Dames Laps enriching more than Danaës golden shower."
22527,"Thou; that from slime of earth man first did'st raise, To beare thine owne expresse similitude, That he in purity might spend his dayes, And all corruption, sinne and lust exclude; Who hast his heart with Grace diuine indude, To be thy temple, and thy Spirits Cell, From me all thoughts, words, acts vnchast seclude, Whilst I the honour of this vertue tell, For in a heart vnpure, chast Spirit will not dwell."
22528,"I take her for that vertue of the minde, Which doth the Furiousnesse of Lust retaine In reasons bounds; And our affections binde In Royall Links of Vertues golden Chaine: As Abstinence doth appetite restraine From foode immoderate: So from desire Vnlawfull, she doth mind and flesh containe, And bounds in limits Generations fire, As meekenesse bounds the rage of Zeales reuenging ire."
22529,"For eu'n as Appetite, without restraint Of Abstinence, delights in Gluttony, And valiant Zeale is, without Meekenesse, taint With cruell rage, and spites malignity: Eu'n so without this vertue Chastitie, The noblest vigour of sweet generation, Abounds in Lust, and foule Adultery, And spends the vitals without moderation, But Chastitie bounds all to lawfull propagation."
22530,"In twofold currents runnes her purer sourse, Body's and minds; The minde remaineth chast, Though one by violence the Body force, Againe thy mind may be corrupt, vnchast, Though thou no act in flesh committed hast: Thine eyes, hands, eares, words, lookes, least lustfull thought She will containe, if in thine heart once plas't: Th' vnspotted Lambe, whose bloud thee dearely bought, Vnchastly neuer spake, look'd, did, once heard or thought."
22531,"She hath her first diuine pure excellence With her beginning, from our Soules creation: That heau'nly, holy, purest influence God breath'd into the Lump his hand did fashion."
22532,"And though at first by Natures deprauation, She as all other vertues did vs leaue, Yet we againe by true mortification Of earthly Members, her againe receiue, And seeke, as members chaste, to chastest head to cleaue."
22533,"For as nought better can the mind containe, Than reading, heau'nly thoughts and meditation, So nothing fleshly lusts doth more restraine, Than Fasting, Prayer, and mortification: Sweet chastity's of heau'nly propagation, And as none gaine gift of Virginity, But by the Spirits chaste sanctification, So none conserue their Sacred Chastitie, But by that Spirits working, Grace and Sanctitie."
22534,"Wherefore as wantonnesse, Adultery, Amongst the wicked workes of flesh are nam'd, So Meekenesse, Continence, and Chastity Are call'd the Spirits Fruits by none defam'd: Talke scurrilous to heare she is asham'd, Her modest lookes are free from Wantonnesse, Vncleannesse, Filthinesse may not be nam'd Within their mouthes, that Chastitie professe, Tongue, eye and eare, th' affections of the heart expresse."
22535,"The Heathen did this Chastitie of minde, In all that came to worship God, require, For they her seated in the Soule did find, From whence comes eu'ry good or bad desire: And as  Doth Bodies made of Elements transcend, So doth the Chastitie of minde aspire, Our Soules to Angels purity doe tend, When we in flesh with them in chastest thoughts contend."
22536,"The fleshes Chastitie is to be free From sinfull touch, or act; that of the mind Is Faith vnuiolate; not to agree To any lustfull thought: we seldome find The body chaste, where minde is ill inclin'd."
22537,"In this she doth Virginity transcend, That she is the Preseruer of mankind, And from chaste nuptiall bed doth children send, Without which all the world would perish soone and end."
22538,"These therefore alwayes her Companions are, Shamefastnesse, Continence, and Modesty, The enemies that of her stand in feare, Are Fornication, wanton Luxury; For she ay chastens their iniquitie: The Seminary's of Delight and Pleasure, Carowsing, Chambering, and Gluttony, Which Worldlings heere account their greatest treasure, She hates, and liues in all by Natures little measure."
22539,"Fulnesse of meat, Sleepe, play, Garrulity, With ease of body, costly vaine attire, The fuell are of Lust and Luxury, Which heere dry vp our humid, and conspire To burne our soules and bodies in hell fire: Other sinnes are without, but generation, To procreate by mutuall desire, Except it be confin'd with moderation, A sinne is 'gainst our body's health, and soules saluation."
22540,"Lust may be lik'ned to some Riuer maine, Bounded by purest Channels of her owne, Wherein so long as she her streames containe, Her waters pleasant, pure and sweet are knowne, But if her swelling waues so proud be growne, They passe their Bounds, and ouerflow the Plaine, Her flouds late pure, now foule & muddy showne, And boundlesse ouerflow the grasse and graine; So rageth lawlesse Lust, let loose from Vertues raine."
22541,"For we are like vnruly Horses all Still neighing after neighbours wiues: But she Vs, as with Bit and Bridle, doth recall, And makes our Lusts to reasons rules agree: Thus two as in one Body ioyned be, And are for mutuall Bounds of sweet desier, And bounded thus, the act is Chastilee, Like to the vsefull Element of fier, Which bounded all preserues; but loos'd is all's destroyer."
22542,"This boundlesse Lust some liken to the Fire, And Brimstone God did downe on Sodome raine, Virginity to mount, God doth require Lot to escape vnto, who doth obtaine Rather in little Zoar to remaine: So they, that from Lusts Sodome-scorching flame, Can not Virginiti's high Mount attaine, May stay in Zoar, which they wedlock name The Citti's safest, but the Mount of greater fame."
22543,"As glorious Sunne, when he doth first arise, Is both of heau'n and earth the wonderment, Eu'n so a woman, modest, chast and wise, Of House and Husband is the ornament: An honest Wife's a gift from heauen sent."
22544,"As light on golden Candlestick shines bright, So Beauty in a woman continent, A Lampe to House and Husband all the night, All day like glorious Beames of Titans heau'nly Light."
22545,"And as that is the noblest victory, Which Souldiers with most danger do obtaine, So she, that keeps her honour'd Chastitie, 'Gainst most temptations, doth most glory gaine: 'Tis harder base affections to restraine In ease and rest, than moderate aright A Kingdome, which by open force we gaine, So many are our Lusts that in vs fight, So strong is Satans force, so subtill is his slight."
22546,"No beauty, forme, or golden Vestiment Do so adorne the Body; as the Mind Is graced by this Vertues Ornament: Without sweet Light the Sun as soone we find, As Shamefastnesse from Chastity disioyn'd: Immodest lookes are Darts against her throwne, When man and womans light aspects are ioyn'd, The battel's fought, both sides are ouerthrowne."
22547,Ah cruell fight!
22548,where neither side defends her owne.
22549,"As eyes from wanton lookes, eu'n so our eare 'Gainst all immodest Charmes, we must inclose; For Shamefastnesses vaile these off doe teare, And our affections prone to Lust vnlose: The Flame and Fier do not sooner close, Than Impudence and foule vnchastity, Then Beauty, like Gold-ring in swinish Nose, Doth roote in Durt of Impudicity, No Body's chast where Mind's ioyne in Adultery."
22550,"Who is not cloth'd in robe pure snowy white Of Chastitie, the Lambe will neuer know: Then Dames, that in faire ornaments delight, Desire to be, as you desire to show: All richest Pearles, Gold, Iewels, heere below, Are nothing to this Gem of Chastitie: No fairer Flower, doth in Loues garden grow, Than Blush of Shamefastnesse, and Modesty, No Iewell like the Belt of Truth and Sanctitie."
22551,"Nor doe I onely heere of you require A Continence, for feare of Law or Fame, But such a Chastitie I doe desire, That neither may your Mind nor Conscience blame▪ Oh let it be vnto your Soules a shame, A Bird should you in Chastity transcend, The Turtle neuer changeth mate or name, For this the Story Iudith doth commend, But this is no Command, but counsell for a friend."
22552,"Take heere for patterne Rachels chastest sonne, Who eu'n a princesse lustfull soft embrace For vertues Loue, not feare of shame, did shun: I heere might grant Lucretia a place, But that selfe-murther doth her foule disgrace: Penelope's a Mappe of Chaste desire, Who farre away all Idlenesse doth chase, Nor takes least heate from Suiters lustfull fire, But twice ten yeeres expects her dearest Lords retire."
22553,"Susan's so chaste, her rumour dares not blame, To this high pitch of honour they doe rise, That shunne all idlenesse, and wanton game, And more than gold their names & honour prize."
22554,"Sobriety them ay accompany's, Both in their speaking, eating, and attire, Their modest gate, sweet carriage, shamefast eyes, Doe proue their Beds be nests of chaste desire, To quench more than enflame the brands of lustfull fire."
22555,"Eu'n fruitfull Venus, true to husbands side, May win from heau'ns high Iuno Queene the golden Ball: And virgin Pallas may be well denide The honour, which chast Matrons doth befall."
22556,Glory of either Sexe!
22557,"Oh how then shall This hand vnchast of that pure chastnesse write, By which Christs-Bride surmounts the daughters all, And doth the Queenes and Concubines delight, Binding eu'n mighty Kings with her most glorious sight?"
22558,"Her turtle-voyce, Doues eyes, as Lilly-white Excels the thornes, so She all Womankind: Yet loues but one, whom she in bed by night, Doth seeke for long, at last alone doth find: He her alone in armes embraceth kind, And she alone delights in his imbrace: Chast Bridegrome, chastest Bride together ioyn'd, Of Saints beget a holy heau'nly race: With this high Mystery, Christ doth chast Wedlocke grace: And brandeth with spirituall Fornication, Those, who on earth their chastest Head forsake, And stoope to Idols and abomination, Here choyce of Louers to themselues to rake: The Saints and Angels they for Bridegrome take, When they before their Images do fall: Thus she the Scarlet-whore herselfe doth make, And they her bastards which she beareth all: Such bastards, with true-heiers, ne'r inherit shall."
22559,"As chast, so we a ielous Bridegrome haue, And as his Loue, like Death, is sure and strong, So's Ielousie as cruell is as graue: Who such a louing Husband dares to wrong, His ielous Fury may expect ere long But now I stray from sweetest Meditation, I ought to end, as I began my song: One word more of a Worthy of our nation, A patterne worth thy learning, loue, and imitation."
22560,"Thomas Archbishop of Yorks famous See; When Doctors counsell, and his friends him praid, For Cure, to vse a female-remedy, And for that turne, him brought a comely mayd; Most piously to them replide, and said, That to preserue his flesh, which was to die, His Soules immortall Chastitie betraid Should neuer be: Such heau'nly chastity Shewes plaine, his Soule doth liue in heau'n eternally."
22561,"But as the Lute, which yeelds a pleasant sound, Doth others, but it selfe, no whit delight; So, if examples, onely I propound To others, and not practise what I write, I neuer may approach the chastest Light, To which our chastest Head before is gone: For no vnchast one commeth in his sight, Except with Magdalen they sigh and grone, And cleanse with floods of teares their filthinesse each one."
22562,"Thus clensd our Soule is like Brides liuing-Well, Whose waters are most pleasant, pure and sweet: Our bodies eyes like fountaines two, which quell And quench all Lusts temptatiōs which they meet: But now adayes we hold this Grace vnmeet, In noble valiant brest to intertaine, Men onely thinke her fit for Dames to greet, And to their basest Lusts let loose the Raine: But sure no Vertue dwels, where she doth not remaine."
22563,"The Flesh against the Spirit coueteth, But if the Spirit manfully hold out, It all Lusts base temptations vanquisheth; Who haue a purpose resolute and stout, To temper their affections, may (no doubt) Defend their honour' gainst Concupiscence; And though they oft opposd are by a rout Of their owne lusts, hels, and worlds violence, Their chast resolued mind maintaines their innocence."
22564,"Then Fooles are they, that when they haue began In spirit, in the flesh will make an end: He that once tastes of Lust, more hardly can Abstaine, than he that neuer did intend: Me, from her first Beginnings, Lord defend!"
22565,"She's like the Serpent that did Eue assaile; She pleasant fruits and pleasures doth pretend, Her mouth drops hony-sweet, but with her taile, She stings eu'n all to hell, with whom she doth preuaile."
22566,"But though I make a cou'nant with mine eyes, Like Iob, no lustfull obiect to behold, Yet oft this Monster will mine heart surprize, And vnawares in sinfull Thought infold: This Serpents cunning sleights can not be told: The best way to auoyd them can be found, Is her aloofe to keepe: if thou be bold To chat with her, she vnawares will wound."
22567,I almost feare her filthinesse now to propound.
22568,"Vncircumcised, rayling Philistine!"
22569,"Who all Gods hoste defies in single fight, I dare not suffer thee to come within, Such is thy force, such is thy cunning slight: Thou art a Gyant of exceeding might."
22570,"If you will hearken vnto my perswasion, Keepe him aloofe, and in the forehead smite."
22571,"Best way to shun Lusts furious inuasion, Is warily here to auoid the least occasion."
22572,"Dauid escapes the Beares and Lyons pawes, And ouerthrowes the Philistine in field, And yet this subtill Serpent him so drawes, His heart vnto her Syrens-songs doth yeeld: Then she him conquers without sword or shield, And leades him by the eye-lids to her snare."
22573,"Heau'ns from such subtill vile allurements shield All those, that haue a Conscience and care, Their hearts fit Temples for thy Spirit to prepare."
22574,"Purge vs with Hyssope, and we shall be pure: Wash vs, we than the Snow shall be more white; Our Soules and Bodies Temple shall be sure A holy house, wherein thou mayst delight: But I the vertue for the vice haue quight, I purpos'd Chastity here to commend, But Lust so fiercely with my Muse doth fight, I scarce mine owne am able to defend: Therefore with Prayer I my Meditation end."
22575,"Oh thou, that mad'st my Soule a little King▪ And in this little-world, my-Body plac't; It subiect making to the ordering Of Reason, wherewith thou this King hast grac't; Set first of all the Soueraignes Kingdome fast, Whereby his Subiects he may rule aright, That is, affections keepe most pure and chast, But most in spirituall chastitie delight, To which adde Constancie, of which I next do write."
22576,"SO oft as I the Splendour do behold Of heau'nly Graces, linkt in golden chaine, Which them so firmely doth together hold, That all they but as one seeme to remaine; My Soule is so delighted with their traine, That she desires to dwell with them for ay; But oft employment, pleasures, cares and gaine, Mine eyes and heart so draw another way, I fleshly motions more than spirituall obay."
22577,"And as these Graces ioyn'd, my soule delight, So doth each singled out by Meditation, Sing I of Loue, I loue with all my might: If Humblenesse, she workes humiliation: So  By Righteousnesse imputed: Mercy kind,  Peace, Meeknesse, Prayer, Zeale, eu'n all I find Do alwayes to my Song, both sute mine heart and mind."
22578,"But such are my Corruptions innate, Hels malice, and the worlds enticements vaine, I can no longer hold that happy state, Than I in Contemplation remaine: This is the cause my Muse is now so faine To sing of Constancie, that heau'nly Grace, Which all the rest doth ay with vs retaine Most glorious Grace!"
22579,"the lustre of whose face, Both heau'nly Loue, and all her Peeres for euer grace."
22580,"For, without Her, the rest are all but showes, Like Corne by high-wayes side, flourish awhile, And seemes more glorious, than that which grows Vpon best bottom'd, dunged, tilled Soyle: But as that onely doth our eyes beguile With flourishes, in calme and gentle spring, But Summers heate, and frosts, it's verdure spoile: Eu'n so, these rootlesse Vertues flourishing, Aduerse or prosp'rous Fortune to confusion bring."
22581,"Thou, that art from Eternity the same, Without least shadow of Variety: Like to the Sun, heau'ns pure world-lightning flame, Constant in beate, course, and serenitie: Three, yet subsisting in one Deitie, Who, though thou seem'st to change with things below, Art farre in truth from Mutability: Oh make mine heart in vertue constant grow, That thence, as from a Fountaine, this Discourse may flow."
22582,"We Constancie a Perseuerance call In some good purpose: for in eu'ry thing We vndertake, right must be first of all Resolu'd of, next, our firme perseuering: A vaine, vnsettled, idle wauering Without iust ground, by Proteus, Poets faine, Who on himselfe as many formes will bring, As he hath idle notions in his braine, Or base desires and Lusts which in his heart remaine."
22583,"But in good purpose to stand fast and sound, Not onely man-like is, but most diuine, Like God, in whom no change was euer found: For as the Sunne, this worlds pure crystall eyne, In heau'n doth alwaies with like glory shine, Though, by the varying Medium's here below, It seeme more glorious in the Summer time, Than when Eolian blasts darke clouds do blow: So Constance is the same, though alt'ring oft in show."
22584,"This Constance is with Patience a twin, Begot by Iupiter of Fortitude; Mother and Babes as like, as neere of kin; Who hath one, with all three must be indude: These lift vp to heroicall habitude, And come from Iustice, and a prudent mind."
22585,"If Fury, Rage, Wrong, Rashnesse do intrude, We them no vertues faire, but vices find, With whom Minerua, nor the Graces euer ioyn'd."
22586,"Patience and Constancie in this agree, Effeminate faint hearts ay to oppose, And men relieue in all extremitie, Vndanted, resolute, who will not loose That liberty, they haue the Good to choose: Thus seeme they one: now marke their difference, Patience all wrongs with courage vndergoes: For without Suffering's no Patience: But Constance is in ioy and paine a firme defence▪ Without Compulsion, free for Vertues sake, Patience constrain'd, oft by necessity, Most cheerefull valiantly doth vndertake To beare, what cannot well auoyded be: One good end Constancie propounds, which she Onely regards: but noble patience, Before her will all euils conquerd see, Which her oppresse in flesh or conscience: Both haue braue resolution, and sound confidence."
22587,"No fury of the headlesse Multitude, No Tyrants rage a constant mind can shake; Though all the world turne to a Chaos rude, The ruines crush him may, but can not make Him stagger, nor Ioues thunder make him quake."
22588,"The Sea may roare, the waues mount to the skies, And threaten him to drowne in deepest Lake: But Fury, Rage, Waues, all he doth despise, And when hopes outward faile, his inward highest rise."
22589,"He constant perseueres vnto the end, Like some good traueller, who giues not in, Till he attaine the place he doth intend: And as the Souldier, that the towne would winne, Fights stoutly, till he conquers all within: Eu'n so in Buildings, Arts, or Merchandize, In any Worke or Science we beginne, It is the end where all our glory lyes; He runs in vaine, that faints before he wins the Prize."
22590,"Though all her meanes, & all her strength do saile, Yet feares she not to hold out to the end, She's still the same, and nothing can preuaile, To alter any Good she doth intend."
22591,"To whom the heau'ns true Constancie do send Within their hearts to dwell, on all occasions Effects most admirable thence transcend, She fils the heart with such secure perswasions; They it defend from all faint-hearted base inuasions."
22592,"A constant man, the most disastrous fate, With a most pleasing forehead entertaines: Integrity so sweetens his estate, As in a pleasant Calme he ay remaines: With her he alwayes in his heart retaines,  And when him Troubles, Losses, Griefe or Paines Assaile, so stoutly patience doth aduance, He liueth most secure, not subiect vnto Chance."
22593,Braue noble Constance!
22594,"who art neuer sound, Except dame Prudence thee accompany, Thou on her counsels and aduice dost found Thy setled resolutions all, whereby Thou standst most firme for Truth and Honesty; Nothing can thee, thus well resolu'd, withstand."
22595,"In vaine and euill things no constancie, But base peruersnesse, we do vnderstand; Iust, honest, profitable's all she takes in hand."
22596,"For perseuerance in a thing that's ill, Is to this Vertue no lesse enemy, Than they that by affections guide their will, With vaine inconstancy and leuitie: Who, of a wanton imbecillity, Stagger and change at eu'ry idle motion; Wind-shaken Reeds, whose instability, Are like the brain-sicke, idle, vaine deuotion Of Nouellists, drunke with hot humours giddy potion."
22597,Prepost'rous fools!
22598,"who when they should frequent Assemblies, hide themselues at home alone; From what they do approue, they soone dissent, Hating what erst they lou'd, dispraise as soone, What erst they liked well: Lo, such a one, Appeares like Cato's Ape, wondrous seuere, With rugged brow; but you may find him soone Dissolu'd in Laughter, or eu'n dead with feare: Such, any publike Office is vnfit to beare."
22599,"No truth of Iudgement or Sinceritie, In such a vaine inconstant mind is found: But Slouth, Fraud, Wantonnesse, Iniquity, With all the basest Vices there abound: This Leuity in youth doth age confound With doting madnesse; and a man declares Wise onely then in shew, not inward sound: But then a braue and constant mind appeares, When constant Resolution honours siluer haires."
22600,"Well said th'old Cynicke, when him friends aduise To leaue his study, and to take his rest: I am, saith he, now running for a prize, And therefore in the end must run my best."
22601,"The shorter time of Life to vs doth rest, More constantly we to our ayme must rend."
22602,"Who runs, saith Paul, the race, is neuer blest With due reward, that holds not to the end: For Constance is the Grace doth all the rest commend."
22603,"And as the man, that hard things vndertakes, Must alwaies haue respect vnto the end, Which all precedent bitternesse sweet makes, Be it for pleasure, glory, gaine, or friend; So he that for Gods glory doth contend, And makes it ay his constant end and ayme, As that's immortall, so it him doth send True immortality in heau'n to gaine, Which comforts him for all his Labour, losse, and paine."
22604,"As Mountains huge stand fast on their foundation, So constant minds on resolutions sound, As they vnmou'd, so without alteration Are good Conclusions built on Vertues ground: A constant man stands on a rocke profound, Which neither stormes, wind, waues, nor force can moue: Crosses, afflictions, can no more confound Him, than wind, waues, and stormes, the rocke remoue, Whose strong foundation stands on faith, hope, truth and loue."
22605,"Anselmus doth a constant man compare Vnto a sixe-square dye, or hewed stone, The sixe flat-sides, his sixe Conditions are, Freedome, Prosperity, Subiection, Aduerstey, Life-publique, and alone: On which soeuer side he chance to fall, He stands vpright with resolution, No changes can his constant mind appall, But as he standeth firme on one side, so on all, As bodily eyes all need Light of Sunne, Whereby they may attaine vnto their end, So on all good and vertuous workes begun, This holy Vertue Constance must attend: And as except the Sunne his Light doth lend, We open in the darke our eyes in vaine, So vainely we good holy workes intend, Except we constant to the end remaine, Like Pilot drown'd in hau'n, when he hath scapt the Maine."
22606,"Is't not absur'd, that we should early rise, Lose sleepe, broile with Suns heat, and take great paine, Onely to winne a fading worthlesse prize, And giue in, when we sure be to obtaine A Crowne, which shall for euer make vs raigne?"
22607,"Except the Souldier Constant be and bold, His Captaines fauour he shall neuer gaine, Vnlesse our spirituall fight we constant hold, Gods comfortable face we neuer shall behold."
22608,"She is the Nurse of Merit, friend of Peace, Way to Reward, sister of Patience, True friendships Band, pure Sanctities increase: Take away Constance, Bounties excellence Doth fade, and Duty wants her recompence; High Fortitude doth want her commendation."
22609,"She is alone the noble Grace, from whence All other Graces haue their Consummation: To her is giu'n, or rather she giues man saluation."
22610,What more like vnto God than Constancie?
22611,"Who ay like Sunne in heau'n remaines the same, Though to descend to mans capacity, He often seeme to change his mind and name."
22612,"The Scriptures then mans changing closely blame, When they affirme, God grieues, or doth repent: 'Tis flesh that alters, God is still the same: So clouds seeme oft to change the Firmament, Which till the Day of Doome stands firme and permanent."
22613,"When as she hath a constat of the right, She therein perseueres vnto the end: Therefore of constat she is Constance hight; And well this name her nature doth commend."
22614,"Her vnderstanding first doth apprehend Things to be good, before she doth beginne▪ Then she most constantly doth ay intend, When she consid'rately hath entred in: Thus all the Saints on earth, a roome in heau'n must win."
22615,"And though all flesh, by our first Parents fall, Are so vnconstant, vaine, and wauering, They haue in words, thoughts, actions, and all, Of Eues fond ficklenesse a relishing: Lo Enoch yet constant perseuering To walke with God, till he him takes away: And Noah, constant in the publishing Of true Repentance, eu'n vntill the day, Flouds come and drowne all Flesh without the Arke that stay."
22616,"Abram most constant in beleefe we find: No feare nor terror Iacob could dismay: Ioseph had rather yron linkes should bind His lims, than from chast Constancie to stray."
22617,"So long as hard'ned Memphians disobay, Moses most constantly for plagues doth call: Lo Iosuahs courage lengthens out the day, Till he Gods enemies destroyeth all; No force, nor fury can his constant mind appall."
22618,"I number may the Starres of heau'n as well, As here the Mirrors all of Constance count, Who champions braue against world, flesh, and hell, In Fortitude and Patience surmount: Many of them I formerly recount, In Fortitudes and Patience Meditation, They all arise from one faire heau'nly fount, That clensing Lauer of Regeneration, Though glittring shows we find oft with the heathen nation."
22619,"Ile name one Regulus Carthage prisoner for all, Who, vpon promise to returne againe, Was sent to Rome, the Senate there to call, Them to perswade against their Cities gaine: But he most nobly will not yeeld to staine His Countries glory, for his priuate good, But constantly perswades them to maintaine Their honour, though he seal'd it with his blood, And constant still the same against all tortures stood."
22620,"His noble mind their cruelties derides, His Executioners are wearied, Yet constant he and cheerefull all abides, Griefe, gaine, for Countries good, he reckoned."
22621,"Yet hath this Constancie beene conquered By thousand Martyrs, which most willingly For Syons glory haue beene martyred; Who when their flesh doth broile, and bowels frie, Sing ioyfull Hallelujahs to God on hie."
22622,"Yet are these, but as Candles to the Sunne, Compared with the constant Lord of all: Beginne we with his apprehension, When his Disciples all from him do fall, Behold him in the high Priests Iudgment-hall: See Herods men of warre him foule deride: Condemn'd by Pilate, scorn'd, abus'd of all: The theefe that raileth, hanging by his side, Yet he most valiant, constant, patient, doth abide."
22623,"But now the Sunne ascended is aboue, Th'Apostles will their Light no longer hide, They constantly before the Rulers proue, That they the Lord of Life had crucifide: And when they are before those Rulers tride, And charg'd to preach no more in Iesus name, They most couragious, constantly replide, Be iudges, whether it were greater blame, You now to disobay or God who vs did frame."
22624,"Paul ready is not onely to be bound, But at Hierusalem for Christ to die, He patient is in all afflictions found, Constant in losses, ioy, prosperity: Read his imprisonments braue history, You there shall more diuine Idea's find, Than Homer, Virgil, Spencer, can supply, Though they in loftiest straines the form haue lin'd Of a most braue, heroicke, constant, noble mind."
22625,"These, as they saw their patterne set before, Vnto the Races end most constant run, But yet their Fortitude's increased more, By Confidence, that he which hath begun So good a worke, it will not leaue vndone: Let Diuels try by crosses and tentation, Hold constant to the end, the Crowne is won."
22626,"Though for awhile we suffer tribulation, A noble, constant mind stands without perturbation."
22627,"I do confesse 'tis difficult and rare, To know ones-selfe; but to be still the same, Is chiefest worke, of all the workes that are: He that so constantly his mind can frame, Deserues the honour of a constant name: He's neere to glorious vertues consummation; His soule minds only heau'n, from whence it came, Secure and free from worlds vaine molestation, And waites heau'ns leisure only for his glad translation."
22628,"Not that I constant Idlenesse commend, Or a retired Life monasticall; No, Constance alwayes Labour doth intend, And is the same approu'd and seene of all: Her words, lookes, gesture, are heroicall; She makes the Body strong, confirmes the mind."
22629,"wo to them, that from her fauour fall, And leaue the right, the crooked way to find; These grieue the Angels, which to guard them are assign'd."
22630,"Grant in Prosperity a prudent heart, And in Aduersity a mind vpright; So shall no pleasures vaine my Soule peruert, Nor crosses or tentations me affright: My selfe I with Gods blessings will delight, So long as please his Bounty them to lend."
22631,"If I must suffer here for doing right, I to the Iust one will my cause commend, Where I am sure to haue a iust and equall end."
22632,"The end, whereon all that is past depends, If then we haue a constant resolution, A holy Life shall bring vs happy ends, Then comes our Fate, to iustest reuolution: We then of Adams losse haue restitution, Ah!"
22633,"all our Labour hath but beene in vaine, If Courage faint in point of Dissolution: This is the howre we happinesse attaine, Or else for euer in hels torments must remaine."
22634,"Lord make me euer mindfull of this Hower, That constant alwayes I may stand prepar'd, Grant me with boldnesse to declare thy power, And in the right of none to be afeard: True happinesse is Constancies reward, A high reward, but he it sure shall gaine, That to the end holds out with due regard."
22635,"Things hardest, Perseuerance will attaine, And Constancy will make them ay with vs remaine."
22636,"Then stand we firme, in what we haue begun, And labour constantly more to obtaine, Lo, thus we heau'n vpon the earth haue won: Thus we that true Security attaine, Which eu'ry wise and good man seeks to gaine: No Greatnesse, King, or Kesar is so high, As those that ouer their affections raigne: Here Peace of Conscience brings Security, Saints wished true content, and Angels Dignity."
22637,"Most blessed Port, that Pilgrims can attaine!"
22638,"Till they arriue at hau'n of Happinesse, Pure Ioy of heart, which onely they do gaine, Where heau'ns sweet Comforter doth dwel in peace: God of all Comfort, in my heart increase This Constancie, that she may me defend In  and ease, And grant, as I the Graces do commend, I may in all continue constant to the end."
22639,"MIght I a Life enioy to my desire, I would no wealth, or honor vaine require, Nor troups of Horsemen after me to ride, Nor clouds of Seruants trouping by my side: In priuate fields, and gardens I would walke; Now with my Muse, now with my Friends to talke: (By Muse, I prayer meane; and Meditation, By Friends, a holy louing Conuersation) At Peace with all, but Ill: My Conscience Both good and quiet, free from foule offence: So when the hower of my change shall come, I with a willing heart will leaue my roome, To whom it is ordain'd by Destiny: Thus I desire to liue, and thus to die."
22640,"Of Courtesie, or Humanity."
22641,"THus haue I brought the Muse from pleasing shade, And gentle sweetest Heliconian Spring, To Stoicks Schoole, to teach her in the trade Of Constancie; and firme perseuering: Some Criticke will me blame for marshalling Cato seuere, with Virgins sweet delight, But nothing more makes for their honouring, Than with that noble Vertue to be dight, Which makes them high accepted eu'n in Princes sight."
22642,"And sure, O Kings, your wisedomes cannot find More prudent Senatours, your States to sway, Than Muses friends, which haue a constant mind, And know as well to gouerne as obay: Who by their Courtesie and Constance may Order your Hals, and wield your State-affaires: For noble Courtesie and Constance ay Adorne Kings Iudgements-Seats, and stately Chaires, And strangers intertaine, that to your Court repaires."
22643,"For in each flourishing and goodly State, Vpon the royall Person of the King, The courteous Courtier hath a place to waite, As well as Senate for wise-gouerning: These both must ioyne in prudent managing Of subiect Prouinces, and to entreate, Of Leagues with Princes on them bordering; But he for all employments is most meete, Where Courtesie and Constance both together greet."
22644,"Wherefore in Court of Loues most royall Queene, Where Graces all, in due administration, Are in most comely order placed seene For Kingdomes Peace, and Princes Delectation: Behold this one thing worth thy Obseruation, Braue Constance ay with Courtesie is ioyn'd, For all men do obserue, with admiration, A courteous carriage, with a constant mind, Adoring eu'n as Gods the valiant gentle kind."
22645,"For sure except these both together meet, Constance alone's so rigid and seuere, She for a pedagogue is farre more meet, Than Office in Loues gentle Court to beare: And, if that single courtesie appeare, Without this resolute most constant Grace, She is but apish complement, to bleare Beholders eyes with Conges and a face, When nought that in her looks, within her heart hath place."
22646,"Dauid the heau'nly Muses darling deare, An Embleme of Humanity I find, In Camp he is vndanted, without feare, In Court of constant, noble, courteous mind, One Ionathans true loue to him inclin'd, The other smites eu'n stout Goliab downe, His Muse the euill spirit of Saul doth bind, And rais'd him from the fould to high renowne, And set vpon his royall head the golden Crowne."
22647,"True noble Courtesie, most heau'nly Grace, Most high to be esteem'd and reckoned Of all; but most of those whom God doth place, Aboue their brethren to be honored: For they that heere vs gouerne in his stead, Ought, like their Lord, to gentlenesse incline, Who, though his Throne shines round with lightning dread, With courteous countenance on his doth shine, Oh gentle King me grant this Grace aright to line."
22648,"Gentlenesse, Courtesie, Humanitie, Diuers in name, in nature are the same, Proceeding from the minds integrity, And are as sparkes of Loues celestiall flame: The outward shews which cōplements we name, Are but as Symboles of her heart and mind, If they be true, she is a noble Dame, If feign'd, she is the shame of womankind, And seekes to lye with all, where she may fauour find."
22649,"I know not whether I may better call Her Sister, or the Child of Grauity, But sure I find these Graces all in all, Delighting in each others Company: The glory of all faire Societie, Most reuerend and amiable Peeres, In whom all sweetnesse shines with Maiesty, Where not least ostentation vaine appeares, Chiefe ornaments of Youth, and grace of filuer haires."
22650,"Both doe proceed from one Dame, Sanctitie, And both employed are in reformation Of manners; but in briefe Humanity A man, humane, like to his name doth fashion: And this to Poets fables gaue occasion, To tell how men were made of stocks and stones, And Beasts turn'd men, by Orpheus his perswasion."
22651,"And for she thus brought men to liue as one, Amphions Harp is said Thebes wals to build alone."
22652,"Yea those, that in Humanity transcended, And others brought vnto ciuility, Were deified when their liues were ended, And euer honour'd of Posterity: Ah!"
22653,what more princely is than Courtesie?
22654,"Thus Kings to King of heau'n most neere do come, When sauage men vnto Society They bring, which else like furious Beasts would runne, And eu'n more cruell to themselues than beasts become."
22655,"Thus Courtesie with adamantine band Men tyes in Friendship, free from Enuies rents, For no offence can part their ioyned hand, Where gentlenesse interprets friends intents; Where Kindnesse euer Courtesies preuents, And gratefull, alwayes striues to ouercome, As  The barbarous and insolentest groome Doth gentle, kinde, benigne, by Courtesie become."
22656,"Man is the weakest creature God hath made, For where all else, by heau'nly Prouidence, Haue bodyes arm'd 'gainst Foes that them inuade, And rage of Times by Natures muniments, Man onely Vertue hath for his defence, This gentle vertue, sweet humanity, With louing kind and tender heart, from whence Flow Pitie, Mercy, Loue, Benignity, Whereby we mutuall helpes to others heere supply."
22657,"For these Companions are to gentlenesse, Which make her heere beloued vnto all; Sweet gracious lookes, and speeches gracefulnesse, Are to this courteous Lady naturall, To which she adding Maiesty withall, And comely Guize doth steale mens hearts away, And free, from sterne morosity and gall, In sweet Tranquillity and Peace doth stay, Immutable, without base perturbation, ay."
22658,"Farre from the base morose and cynnicall, That to all others manners are auerse, Who are so crooked, crosse and criticall, In their owne dispositions so peruerse, No friend with them is able to conuerse, Delighting to be conuersant with none; But sullen, truculent, so sterne and fierce, You easier may wring water from a stone."
22659,Then mirth and gentle words; or lookes from such an one.
22660,"Neighbourhood, Countreys-Loue, Affinity, Kindred and Friendship are cold barren names; Such neither like nor loue the Company Of honest equals, nor of gentle Dames: This Vice in eu'ry man eu'n Nature blames, But most in Officers of Court or State, For Courteous grauity her Courtier frames;  Faire Almas bounteous Peares in all to imitate."
22661,"As he is worthy Death, who heere denyes His brother Water from a liuing Spring, Or him Sunnes comfortable Beames enuyes, Or from his Candles-light, light-borrowing, Or to direct aright the wandering; So he is most discourteous, inhumane, Who when he profit may to others bring, Without least Damage to himselfe, or blame, Yet to his brother churlishly denies the same."
22662,"Humanity's like fairest Iuly-flower With silken leaues, which bud, doth yet inclose, Which faire dispreading by sweet Natures power As she doth waxe broader and sweeter blowes; No flower in Loues fairest garden growes, That more delights the smell, affects the eye, But as from roote bright hue and sweetnesse flowes, So from the heart springs fairest Courtesie, Else as the Flower fades, so dyes Humanity."
22663,"For as a gentle heart it selfe bewrayes, By doing courteous deeds, with free delight, Eu'n so base dunghill minde it selfe displayes, In malice, churlishnesse, reuenge and spight: Humanity is Friendships chiefest night,  Than to accept more ready to requite, Gifts are to her like Oyle powr'd on the flame, Which more and more her heart with friendly loue inflame."
22664,"As blowing on hot coales them more enflames, But water on them powr'd extinguisheth; So bitter words enrage, but soft reclaimes: One ire appeaseth, th'other kindleth: And as more safe on Sea he trauelleth, That passeth on with soft and gentle blast, Than whom full Sailes like arrow carryeth: So stands the mild, sweet gentle man more fast, Than he whose furious mood beares all before in hast."
22665,"As lukewarme water cooles an inflamation, So courteous language, anger pacifies, And as wild horse is tam'd by mild traction, So cruell foes are wonne by courtesies: We easier our most sauage enemies Subdue by Gentlenesse, than cruelty, Wild Hawkes the Faulkner surer to him tyes, By handling gently, and familiarly, Than if he neuer suffer'd them from fist to fly."
22666,"The Bough by gentlenesse is easily bent, Which handled boistrously would break in sunder, Thus fiercest Bull is with the yoake content, And gentlenesse brings cruell Tygres vnder: Philosophers affirme that dint of Thunder, Doth neuer hurt, where it doth yeelding find, It melts the blade, and yet behold and wonder!"
22667,"The scabberd's not consum'd, it bones doth grind, And yet the yeelding flesh is neither scorch'd nor pin'd."
22668,"Wisely, said he, that thought wise men below Should not be mou'd with those which do offend, But where they vices find increase and grow, Should striue and do their best them to amend; Like good Physicians, who when they attend Their Patients, are not angry with their fit, But to the cure best skill and cunning bend: As all are sonnes of Eue, we sinne commit, But he is most like God, that heere amendeth it."
22669,"Humanitie may haue a threefold sense, Mans Nature, Vertue, and his education, In humane Arts, and pure Intelligence; From whence she seemes to haue denomination: And therefore Liberall Arts by eu'ry Nation, Are call'd the studies of humanity, And breed in man a courteous conuersation, With gentle manners and ciuility, Which onely heau'ns bestow on Muses Nursery."
22670,"And hence it is, that rustique Boores and Clownes, Who want the good of ciuill education, So rude and rustique are in Countrey townes, When those, that haue with Muses conuersation, Or neere to Princes Courts their habitation, Become more ciuill, sociable, kinde; Hence 'tis that eu'ry rude and sauage nation, Where gentle Arts abide not, are inclin'd To rustique force, and sauage cruelty of mind."
22671,"No greater Grace the heau'ns to man afford, Than gentle breeding vp in heau'nly lore, By thews and holy knowledge to accord Their wrathfull furious Passions euermore: Plato the Gods immortall doth adore, That they him reasonable made, no Beast; A Man, no Woman: But it glads him more, That he knew humane Arts, and heau'nly best, By which he thought himselfe in life and death most blest."
22672,"The Emperour Traiane; when his friends him blame As carelesse of imperiall Maiesty, Because so mild, sweet, gentle he became And affable to all his company; Said he would so be in high Sou'raignty To others: as if else he priuate were, He wish'd to find the royall Dignity, With whom all good men ought be free from feare, But cruell, vile, malicious, neuer should come there."
22673,"Philip, who had by Liberalitie Obliged, as he thought, to him a Nation, Receiued nought but Scorne for Courtesie, Wherefore his Courtiers, mou'd with indignation, Perswade their King vnto reuenge and passion: Soft, said the Prince, if these men doe requite Our benefits, in such a scornefull fashion, They vs for iniuries will more despight: True patterne of a prudent, patient, gentle Knight."
22674,Is Iury barren then of gentle deed?
22675,"Because I onely of the Nations tell, The liues of Abram, Isaac, Ioseph reade, And see how they in Courtesie excell: When as betwixt the Heardmen strife befell, Abram leaues to his nephew Let the Plaine, His Courtesie the Angels greetes so well, Their errand gently they to him explaine, Yea gracious God to him familiar talke did daigne."
22676,"Most gentle Iacob, courteous like thy Sire, Though Laban churlishly thee handeled; Let all thy patient gentlenesse admire, When thou didst see thy Dina rauished, And for her Rape a Nation slaughtered: Thy gentle Ioseph into Egypt sold, Who when he sees his brethren humbeled, Could not his heart and eyes from weeping hold, The Dreames thus prouing true, which he before had told."
22677,"Though Shemei barke, Dauid forbids to smite, Oh let him curse, my sonne me seekes to kill: The Lord with Blessings may his Curse require, If in his fauour I continue still, I shall returne, else be it as he will."
22678,"Mephibosheth must haue his fathers land, And at his Table eate of Bread his fill, Chimham in old Barzellais roome shall stand, And nothing be denide him at King Dauids hand."
22679,"But Kings and People, all learne gentlenesse Of our most courteous, gentle King of Kings, Who, when he walk'd on earth in lowlinesse, And was the Lord and Maker of all things, Neuer vs'd bitter words nor threatenings, But was to meanest, courteous, gentle, mild; The Lord rebuke thee, Michael onely sings When Satans malice would haue him beguil'd Of Moses body; but he neuer him reuil'd."
22680,"As of the head, so of the members learne Mildnesse, Humanity, and Gentlenesse, Speeches morose, and countenances sterne Neuer agree with worth and noblenesse: Nor to the vessels of true holinesse: And Dames that soft and tender are by kind, Adorn'd with Natures goodliest gracefulnesse, Be gentle, humble, soft and meeke in mind, So you with God and Man, shall grace and fauour find."
22681,"No vertue so adornes a valiant man, Nor vertuous Dame, whom valiant men doe loue, As courtesie, which best direct them can To beare themselues in all as doth behoue: Whether them God hath plast to rule aboue, Or wait below, it them befits to know Their Duties, that none iustly may reproue Their rudenesse, in not giuing what they ow: Who giues each man his due, doth great discretion show."
22682,"Nothing more wins mens hearts than gentle words, Nor their affections than sweet lookes delight, If Men, like Beasts, should make the strongest Lords, And be enrag'd one at anothers sight, Societie of men would perish quight, The rules of Policies and States would faile; Mens liues should be in hazzard of each wight, That them by force or cunning would assaile, Yea sauage Beasts against their weakenesse would preuaile."
22683,"Rude manners those that haue them doe infest, And grieuous are to all they deale withall, But gentlenesse in Angels, Man, and Beast, Is much commended and belou'd of all: The Poets want the Gods in heau'n to call Most gentle, bountifull, and amiable; But Fiends and Furies, cruell, tetricall, To first they Temples build, and prayers fable, Counting th'other dreadfull and abominable."
22684,"If Socrates a froward wife would beare, As men ride horses wild; that they may know To rule them better that well tamed were, Much more should Christians sweetly beare the blow Of proud and cruell worldlings heere below: And not to grieue at their prosperitie, Though heere they seeme in wealth and blisse to flow, Alas such stand in places slippery, And in their haughty pride shall perish suddenly."
22685,"Who that most wicked Sect doe imitate, That would all friendship and acquaintance shun, That they might heere enioy more happy fate, And partners of no others losse become: One burthen is inough for any one, Oh!"
22686,"why should others losses them molest: By this is all Humanity vndone, And man made more vngentle than a beast, The Heathen therefore did such beastlinesse detest."
22687,"The first and speciall Duty, which we ow, Is Loue to God, which we call Piety; Next, is the Mercy we to men do show, And this indeed is true Humanity: This is the summe of all Diuinity; And this to Piety doth Practice ioyne: All loue the Lord in words, but doe deny Their hearts and hands to Mercy to incline, God grant they both in vs together may combine."
22688,"Chiefe Band amongst men is Humanity, Which who would breake, deserues eternall palne, From one man all deriue their pedigree, And therefore Kinsmen all in him remaine: From one God, we our soules doe all obtaine, And so we brethren are, and neerer ioyn'd In Soule than Body: And we hope in vaine, If all into one head be not conioyn'd, And feele not all one Spirit working in our minde."
22689,Inhumane cruell Beasts!
22690,"which take delight Without iust cause Gods image to destroy, Torment, kill, torture, cruelly despight, When God would haue all liue in amity."
22691,Oh measure others by thy misery!
22692,"No man without anothers ayd can liue, He that denies helpe in aduersitie, None at his need vnto him helpe shall giue, As none shall be forgiu'n, that doth not heere forgiue."
22693,"No man, that doth obey Dame Natures hest, Can hurt a man, much lesse him spoile or kill: Learne of the gentle, meeke, and harmlesse beast, How he Society doth couet still: The Shepheards gentle Flocks the Plaines do fill, Wolues, Beares and Tygres loue to Lord alone: Where they their yong ones with the fat may fill, And forrage all the Countrey for their owne, Lo Mercy there is strange, where Misery's vnknowne."
22694,"Such in their Complement are onely kind; And where they kindnesse may receiue againe, Oh be mine heart to gentlenesse inclind!"
22695,"Not for base recompence, reward, or gaine, But for his sake, who for my sinne was slaine: But ouer-courteously I doe abuse My Readers patience, with vngentle straine, Yet if he gentle be, he cannot chuse, But my most willing mind, though not my Verse excuse."
22696,"MY Muse now fares like some Geometrician, That hauing view'd on Globe terrestriall The Earth, and like a good Mathematician, Cast vp the Measure of her craggy ball, Now thinkes that all doth in his Compasse fall, But sayling forth by Compasse, Card, and Sterne, With his owne eyes it to discouer all, He many Iles and Regions doth discerne, Which neuer by the Map he able was to learne."
22697,"So when I first in Vertues Maps had read, Of all the Graces link'd in golden Chaine, I thought I had them all discouered, And able was their Natures to explaine, But more that I doe labour and take paine, To tell their Numbers, Nature, Qualities, More numberlesse I find their glorious traine, And more admire their Grace and Dignities, And more of them I write, the more my Muse descry's."
22698,"But none more faire I can amongst them find, Than next I write of comely Grauity, Which as I said, goes linked and combin'd With gentle, noble, sweet Humanitie, Whom follow Constancy and Chastity Attending alwayes on this stately Peere, Who for her venerable Maiesty, Is to the Queene of Loue her selfe most deare, And alwayes tires her face, which court'sie washeth cleare."
22699,"Now helpe, O heau'nly Queene!"
22700,"Her to adorne that beautify's you And lift my Muse to fly aboue the , Oh neuer let my fit and fury fall, Whil'st I describe this Grace Maiesticall; Which with her comely presence doth adorne The Temple, Iudgement Seat, and Princes Hall, With Academies, where the Muse was borne, And ay defends the ancient from the yongers scorne."
22701,"She is an inward splendour of the mind, Which makes the whole man gracious, commendable, The outward manners which in her we finde, Her lookes and gestures, faire and delectable, Are but as Beames of that bright admirable Transcendent Grace, which in her heart doth shine, To make words, lookes, and actions venerable, And Dignity and Comelinesse to ioyne, With manners Sanctitie, which make a man Diuine."
22702,"For sure all reuerend shewes of Grauity, Are but externall good expos'd to sight, Except they haue fast rooting inwardly, And from the heart receiue their Splendour bright, As Maiesty, is without Goodnesse light, So's Grauity without true holinesse, 'Tis that which makes vs graue, and to delight In sober honesty, and comelinesse, And to be patternes of all Grace and godlinesse."
22703,"She is that holy Law and Rule of Life, Of constancie and gracious manners borne, Free from lasciuious Loue, or causelesse strife, And euer doth most gloriously adorne Him, before whom her glorious ensigne's borne, She is not lowring hard, to equals proud, To betters base, nor doth inferiours scorne, , wanton, loose, exulting, lowd, Her habit, looke, attire, all modesty doth shroud."
22704,"Her Ornaments are not Wealth, Strength, or Power, Sumptuous apparell, decking Limbs, or face, Sweet Chastitie of Manners is her Dower, Her outward parts, adorn'd with inward Grace: These be the ornaments that most her grace, Not made by any skilfull hand, or Art; Vertue the Queene of all things did enchace These workes of wondrous Glory in her heart, Wherewith she now adornes and graceth euery part."
22705,"By these she casting out all perturbation, Perpetuall tranquillity attaines, And shines in Grace, which at her first Creation, She from the Fountaine of all Grace obtaines, And thus she true immortall honour games, Not that which leanes on popular vaine blast; But that whereby the Queene of Vertue raignes, And stands vpon her vertuous thoughts so fast, She from the pitch of honour cannot be displas't."
22706,"Hence 'tis, that who can to this pitch attaine, Admits of nought vnseemely to be done, His mind no euill cogitations staine, His actions chast as mind from whence they come, Many indiffirent things are fit for some, Which some more graue and noble ill beseeme; It doth no Iudge or Magistrate become, In seruants habit publique to be seene, What Country Maid commends, may ill beseeme a Queene."
22707,"Iustly did Philip reprehend his Sonne, When, to the Harpe, he heard him sweetly sing, This well, saith he, soft Ladies doth become, But Drums and Trumpets best beseeme a King; It is for Clarkes no commendable thing, To Hunt, Hawke, and great Horse for seruice traine, Which highest Grace to Gentlemen doth bring, Poets may witty pleasant fictions faine, Which in a graue Diuine would be accounted vaine."
22708,"Man in Gods Image to be like a Beast, Neigh like a Horse, grunt, swill, like to a Swine, Such things doth Grauity as base detest, Equality and Comelinesse doe shine, In her  In going, sitting, gestures, and deuotions; She words perplext, contentions, doth decline, Plaine, constant, resolute, are all her motions, Proceeding from her hearts, pure, wise, & heau'nly notions."
22709,"Her words fly not at randome, all do flow From Fountaine of pure vnderstanding heart: Her gestures are not quick, nor yet too slow, Sweetly seuere, consid'rates in each part: Her looke's not Cruell, nor compos'd by Art, Graue and seuere, yet gentle, liberall, Sweet Mistris of the Graces!"
22710,"where thou art They are most gracious and comely all, Wherefore I them thy Schollers all aright may call, Nay rather thy companions: Poets feigne Astréa call'd from heau'n, with thee to dwell, And to put all her Nymphs to thee; to traine Them vp in Vertue as beseemeth well: To men all gracefull manners thou dost tell, Thou teachest Kings to rule their Subiects right, Fathers their Duties to their sonnes to spell, Seruants to Masters, Lady to her Knight, No Policy or force without thee rules aright."
22711,"thou teachest to eschew All Leuity, vaine feare, and ostentation,  Which shewes a mind subiect to perturbation, Delighting in anothers molestation: These are like Scorpions, whose malignity, To all, comes from their natures inclination, And from their Malice comes Morositie, Auerse to all, but most to Truth and honesty."
22712,"As Vrchin, which hath pricks vpon his skin, 'Mongst Thorns, and Bryers alwayes takes delight, So in all businesse these enter in, They vse morose, vnciuill, barb'rous might; They bring within them Malice, Gall & Spight."
22713,"How-euer be the thing wherein they deale, Oh God forbid!"
22714,"such base malicious Sprite Be euer Iudge in Iudahs common-weale: Such take large Toule, but neuer care to grind the meale."
22715,"Some dayes Euripus seu'n times ebbs and flowes, Some other dayes, nor flowes nor ebbs at all, The mouing of this Riuer's like to those, That haue not Grauity habituall: Vnlike themselues, loose, sparing, prodigall, Idle precipite, vaine, for either part Most earnest, vehement, patheticall, These their owne businesse and friends peruert, For want of Grauity, and Constance in their heart."
22716,"But Grauitie is like the Ocean maine, Into whose Treasure all the Flouds doe flow, Which he as constantly sends out againe, Yet hereby doth, nor lesse, nor greater grow, He neither swels, nor banks doth ouerflow, When greater summes his tributaries pay, Nor is base sparing, when their pay is slow, The windes may tosse his waues but not dismay, He smiles so soone to see his troubles blowne away."
22717,"As Censor in the Senate-house of Rome, So is this Grace amongst the Graces all; And as none might into the Senate come, But those whom he did in his Conscript call: So none may come into the Graces Hall, But they must be conscrib'd by Grauity, And those she will not haue come there at all, She passeth by them for their Leuity, Such confidence haue all in her integritie."
22718,"But she most like is to the glorious Sunne, Whose chearefull countenance is still the same; And like him constantly one course doth runne, Of which, she neuer weary is or lame: From him's all elementall heate and flame, With her all liuely spirituall doth dwell: He lightens all with his enlightning beame, Sinnes, Clouds, and Ignorance she doth expell: Sol prince of Lights, she of all Graces beares the bell."
22719,"She's like that Breath, which God is said to breathe Into mans face for immortality, His owne sweet Image, which he did bequeath To Adam, Righteousnesse, and Sanctitie: For where is inward holy Grauity, All Graces spirituall are likewise found, Where graue and modest outward Courtesie, There outward comely Graces all are found, Without the one we neuer find the other sound."
22720,"No firmer, or more ready muniment, 'Gainst Enuie, Malice, and each enemy, That here mankind assaile, and circumuent, Than high, sublime, graue Manners maiestie; Who outward hath and inward Grauitie, Concords with all without, hath Peace within, Of Vertues all consent, and Vnity, Gods image thus renew'd, doth heere begin, In humane flesh to vanquish Lust, and mortall Sinne."
22721,"Old Ages honour, garland of gray-haires, Most ample orders Grace, and dignity, The highest seates of Iustice, richest chaires Of State, from her haue all their maiestie: She swayes the Scepter of high Sou'raignty, The fairest Cope which Arons sonnes do weare, Sweet, reu'rend, amiable Grauitie!"
22722,"To thee I nothing find fit to compare, All Simile's but shadowes to thy substance are."
22723,"For in the graue and reu'rend do shine All Goodnesse, Constancie, and Sapience, The Manners which were in the golden time, The Age when raigned Right and Innocence, Before Debate, Strife, and Maleuolence Were hatcht, since fledge, now taught aloft to sore; Inueterate in reprobated Sense, Habituated so in Vices lore, They scoffe at graue examples, all that went before."
22724,"At first, I say, when in the golden Age, Graue Saturne did Olympus Scepter sway, Of high esteeme were then the ancient Sage, And mortals all did their behests obay; But since Ioue did by violence betray His father, and aspired to his Crowne, Seuerer Grauity is driu'n away: The Iouiall men are onely of renowne, Graue Saturne on their Lusts too rigidly doth frowne."
22725,"As long as Eue maintaines her Grauitie, So long in her Integrity she stood: But when neglecting Grace and Maiestie, She of her vassall learnes the ill from good, The Serpent, with his base malicious brood, Soone brings her to an euerlasting blame; She euill did, and euill vnderstood, And seekes to hide her naked parts from shame, Which perfect Natures Grauitie did neuer blame."
22726,"Oh wondrous Grace of heau'nly Grauitie, If in her likenesse she should here appeare!"
22727,"But Adam lost her with Integrity, Since, she could neuer be discerned cleare: But when our Head with vs conuersed here, Onely some Beames he pleaseth to bestow Vpon his members to himselfe most deare, Whereby they shine like little lamps below, And, as he lends them light, they great or lesser show."
22728,"If you examples of this Grace desire, You must the Fathers liues, and Stories reade, She a continued habit doth require, Nor is expressed in a single deed, I easier to you could their slips areed, As Noah graue yet ouertane with wine, And Lot thus punish't with incestuous deed."
22729,"I read, that once eu'n Abram did decline, And fainting, fell from this high Grauitie diuine."
22730,"Could I now Iob here picture in a Verse, I might her comeliest feature to you show, Reade his whole life: I onely will rehearse What he would haue his vniust friends to know: Did he vnto the Seat of Iudgement goe; The youngmen saw him, and themselues did hide, The aged rise; the Princes tongues that flow In Eloquence, their talking lay aside."
22731,"all mouths are shut, all eares are open wide."
22732,"I do not reade, that graue Iudge Samuel Did euer from this heau'nly Grace decline, For all the time he iudged Israel: But sure his Eli Tutor did so much incline To gentlenesse, he swerued from her line."
22733,"where was then thy Grauity, When thou didst make Vriah drunke with wine, That so he might go with thy Lemman lie, To couer thy base Sinne of foule Adultery?"
22734,"That innocent pure golden Grauitie, With which thou in a linnen Ephod dight, Laidst by thy sou'raigne kingly Maiestie, To dance before the Lord with all thy might: Oh thus to be vncouerd in the sight Of maides, and seruants, well becomes a King, Though prophane wicked Michols vs despight, Yet when to God we our Deuotions bring, To be most vile and meeke is no dishonouring."
22735,"Should I now passe by Iudges, Prophets, Kings, And from th'Apostles times this Vertue trace, To shew how silly fisher-men did things More graue and venerable in their place, Than all the Prelates that haue highest grace, My selfe and Reader I too much should spend: Let's labour in our hearts her to embrace, For that indeed is Meditations end, In vaine hee sees the right, that doth the wrong way wend."
22736,"By two or three examples, Ile commend This Grace, as she did with the Heathen won: Cato, one from the Senate did suspend, Because he kist his wife before his sonne: A Poet crauing of a Iudge alone, To do him fauour against Law, replide, As Poet is not good, whose Vertues run Not by the rules of Art: so Iudge is wide, That layes, for feare or fauour, Lawes and right aside."
22737,"A Spartane lewd, in serious consultation, Giuing his good aduice, was followed Of all the Senate in their Conuocation; And the Decree in his name entered: A graue old man them better counselled, That they their honour would not so defame, To haue Decrees in such names registred: The Sentence might continue still the same, Chang'd onely from a lewd, vnto a graue mans name Themistocles is said, once with his friend, After the Persians fatall ouerthrow, To see that mighty slaughter, to descend Vnto the Sea, which wont to ebbe and flow; Which many Chains and Bracelets vp did throw: These when he saw thus lying on the shore, He them, thus saying, to his friend doth show, Thou art no Captaine, gather them therefore: Shewing, he Grauity, than Gold esteemed more."
22738,"shall a Captaine of the heathen host, For Grauity despise all gold and gaine?"
22739,"And Christians, thou whose Soule alone hath cost More than all wealth that doth on earth remaine, Neglect this Grace a little pelfe to gaine?"
22740,"what do such, but Esaus Birth-right sell, Or like the Prodigall, eate swill and graine: If they at home with Grauity would dwell, Manna should be their food, their drinke sweet liuing-Well."
22741,"how many be that do professe Themselues great friends to gracious Grauitie, And do in outward shewes expresse no lesse?"
22742,"But they at home are full of Luxurie, Base Wantonnesse, and all Immodesty; Especially obscene in filthy Lust: Thus Cupid binds Ioues awfull Maiestie; Uenus haue her petitions granted must, When Iuno's and Minerua's throwne are in the dust."
22743,"I could wish, but neuer hope to see The golden-Age, when eu'ry one was plaine, And hearts and faces did in one agree; Dissembling was not knowne all Saturnes raigne."
22744,"The Matrons modest Virgins sought to gaine By patternes gra, in Vertue to begin Their youth, the ancient vp in labour traine; To moderate their Lust, and keepe from sinne: That as they seem'd without, so they might be within."
22745,"Three things the Persians did teach their youth, To ride a horse, the Bow aright to draw, The last thing was, in all to tell the Truth; This made them of ill doing stand in aw, They being bound to Truth, as to a law."
22746,"This last, true inward Grauitie would frame, Considering God secret sinnes will draw To light on earth, to our disgrace and blame, Or else hereafter to our greater paine and shame."
22747,"But I confesse, we are so farre from feare Of wanton loosenesse in our priuacie, That openly we without blushing beare The ensignes of our Impudicitie."
22748,"So farre from antique grauer Modestie, In gestures, goings, lookes, vailes, and attire: They now are baits of Lust and Luxurie, And fewell to increase our shamelesse fire, Which should be limited in Wedlocks chast desire."
22749,"And not shewes onely, but our sweetest songs, Are now the Baits of Lust and Wantonnesse; In Ribaldry we exercise our toungs, With vnchast tales we intertaine our guesse; Without these now no mirth or cheerefulnesse."
22750,"poore Grauity is quite vndone, Her honours blended by Lasciuiousnesse; The Signes will tell you, where good-Ale doth won, 'Tis filthinesse to speake, what's filthy to be done."
22751,Diuinest Spirits!
22752,Muses Darlings deare!
22753,"That in sublimest Numbers take delight, Oh!"
22754,"let your Fountaines streame as pure and cleare, As runs the Helicon whereof you write: Dim not your pure, sublime, most glorious light, With lustfull thought, or wanton cogitation, But spend the honour of your Furies might, In holy, sweete, transcendent Contemplation, And as your matter's graue, so be your conuersation."
22755,"You by the Muses are inaugurate Censors of Manners, inward Sanctitie, As of the outward is the Magistrate; Oh both be patternes of true Grauitie!"
22756,"And you shall both shine like a Deitie, Amongst the mortals which are here below: Your priuate honour, publike maiestie, By Grauitie more glorious shall show, So as your outward truly doth from inward flow."
22757,"Wiues, Matrons, Widowes, Virgins faire be graue, Dame Chastitie defend your Bodies may From lawlesse Lust: This Vertue will you saue From lustfull proffer without saying nay; The boldest dares not Grauitie assay; She better than a thousand Argo's eyes, All lustfull lookes and glances keepes away, And silenceth inchanting Mercuries: That Matron's truly chast, whom no man euer tryes."
22758,"God of all Grace, I humbly beg this Grace Of inward, and of outward Grauitie, Graue in my Muses, graue in publique place, Graue with my friends, graue in my Family, Graue in Aduersitie, Prosperitie, In all religious Duties truely graue: Be I in Bondage, or at Libertie, In health, or sicknesse, Grauitie I craue."
22759,"In all from crying Sinnes, this Grace my Soule shall saue."
22760,"And though to sing of Grauitie I cease, Yet neuer will I cease her Contemplation."
22761,"As yeeres, so must my Grauity increase."
22762,"The Author of all heau'nly Cogitation, Me teach her practice in my Conuersation."
22763,"This Booke began with Peace, I now will end With Grauity both Booke and Meditation: God grant it Readers hearts may all amend, As it hath done the Authors, when the same he pen'd."

22797,THE FIRST BOOKE OF IOSEPH.
22798,"Of him, whom God by brethrens enuy sent From Canaan to Egypt, to preuent Great dearth; I sing; thou that didst him protect In all his trauels, me in mine direct."
22799,"NOw dwelt the holy Patriarch Israel At rest, in Canaan in his fathers cell, For Esau now did in mount Seir raigne, One country could not all their flocks su∣stain: And hauing many stormes and dangers past, Now hop'd in quiet to haue liu'd at last, Freed from his brothers hate and menacing, From Labans cruell gripes and coueting, His teares for losse of Rachel now were dride, For Dina's rape, and Simeons homicide, His sonnes abroad, in Peace their flocks do tend, Ioseph at home, his father doth attend: When lo!"
22800,"an enuious Spirit (which did reede, In holy Iacob, Isaacks promisd seede, Which he to come of Ioseph most did feare."
22801,"Because he to his father was so deare) One day amongst the sonnes of God appeard, Before the Lord, desiring to be heard: And thus began: Dread Thunderer: be iust, Hast thou not raisd vp sinfull man from dust, To make those heau'nly Mansions, ay his owne, From which thou Angels in thy wrath hast throwne And damn'd?"
22802,"yet we but once did thee displease, But he offends each houre, yet liues at ease: Iacob in Isaacks Tents doth quiet liue, As with his Blessing he him Peace did giue; And though by thy Decree man ought attaine To Ioyes of Heau'n, by sorrow, care, and paine▪ To him thou so benigne and gratious art, Hee sees the Pleasures, neuer feeles the smart; So as it seemes 'tis thy determination, To make base Man for blisse, Vs for damnation: How hast thou blessed him on eu'ry side?"
22803,"His Children many, his Possessions wide; His flocks abound and couer all the Land, So thou dost blesse all workes that passe his hand: Well may he serue thee for so great reward, But touch him, thou shalt see his slight regard, Vexe thou but him, or any of his race, And he will thee blaspheme vnto thy face: When thus, th'Almightie; say thou what thou can, Iacob's a matchlesse, iust and perfect man, Who feareth God, doth good, escheweth ill, Try him or his, so thou no bloud dost spill."
22804,"Thus now had Satan his desires attain'd, By Iacobs Angell till that time restrain'd; And since for bloud he could not get permission, He priuily sowes Enuie and Sedition, Which make oft greater rents in Church and State, Then open enmitie and knowne debate: Simeon and Leui, once his Instruments Of murther, vnder couer'd false intents, With the two handmaids sonnes shall kindle hate, And Enuy, for to ouerthrow the state Of simple Ioseph, who in honest sort, To Israel brought his brethrens ill report; And in plaine meaning did to them vnfold His dreames by day, which God by night had told: Which enuiously this Sp'rit interpreting, As if he of his Brethren would be king; And for because he was to Iacob deare, And tales to him, as they suspect did beare▪ He by their malice labours cunningly, To ruine Iacob and his Family In Iosephs losse: Thus did the enuious Fiend Proiect destruction, God a blessed end."
22805,"Little hereof thought good old Iacob, when He him to Sichem to his bretheren Doth send: where wandring he at last was told▪ That they at Dothan pastured their fold On side of hill which Sol with chearefull eyes, Salutes and comforts soone as he doth rise; Vnder a stately Oake, whose armes dispread, From Sunne and Raine all vnder sheltered, Neare fairest meadowes and the Riuer side, These Brethren with their Flockes in Tents abide, More healthfull, pleasant, fruitfull, spatious plaine, Was not in Canaan to be seene againe, Where whilst their Flockes doe feede, they haue good leasure, To leape, dance, caroll, sleepe, and take their pleasure, And they that feele within diuiner motions, In priuate shades may fall to their deuotions, And imitate the plumed heaun'ly Quire, Who in sweete notes Gods goodnesse doe admire; Hither comes Ioseph, where he first admires The places fertilenesse and faire attires, For his owne coate, all party coloured, Seemd nought to that the ground apparelled: But his ten brethren him no sooner spie, But lo!"
22806,"here comes the dreamer, all do crie Come let vs kill, and in some pit him cast, Then see how all his Dreames will proue at last."
22807,"And when our father misseth him, weele say, Some wicked beast deuour'd him on the way: And had not Prouidence with-held their knife By Ruben, they then taken had his life: Full glad to see his Brethren was the childe, And with a pleasing face vpon them smilde, As little thinking by them to be sold, As they at Nile his glory to behold, As cruell Cain against his brother rose, When nothing lesse good Abel did suppose: And as fierce Simeon came most cruelly On Sichem looking for affinity: So Iacobs sonnes vnwares on Ioseph run, Who kindly to salute them then did come, One bends his fist, another drawes his knife, Another sweares he'le teare from his life."
22808,"saith another, thou comest for a spy, That thou returning home maist tell a lye, And vs disgrace in our old fathers eare, And be alone his ioy and darling deare: Lo, saith another, we our sheaues must bring, And do to thee obeisance as our king: One saith, thou art the Sunne, we starres of night, And must all bow, whence we do borrow light: Then stripping off his party coloured coate, They blindfold him, and on the shoulder smote: And said, since thou diuin'st and dreamst so right, Reckon now which of vs thee last did smite."
22809,"Whilst Lambe-like he before the sharer lies, Mute and amaz'd, yet thus at last replies."
22810,"Ah brethren deare, though now too late, I proue The peril's not so great in Hate as Loue: Cain mortall hate did to his brother beare, For that his offrings acceptable were, My father hardly scap't mine Vncles knife, Because he was Rebecca's dearest life: So did you and your mother mine despise, Because she gratious was in Iacobs eyes; Now him, that neuer did or thought you ill, Because my father loues me, you will kill: To him once, I confesse, I did relate An ill report I heard, not for least hate Or malice that my brethren I did beare, But that you knowing it, might better cleare: That which my father did but folly deeme, To tell mine idle dreames, will you esteeme It capitall?"
22811,"oh brethren deare, forbeare, If not for loue or pittie, yet for feare Of vengeance, which will follow fratricide, Cains curse shall euer on that house abide, If all consent your Brother here to slay, Iacob hath lost eleu'n sonnes in one day: And whence shall then that blessed one proceede God promisd in our father Isaacks seede?"
22812,"That cursed Cham, from whom these nations come Which here inhabite, neuer yet haue done So foule a sinne; nor Nimrods cruell sword Was ere in his owne brothers blood engor'd: A brothers sight rough Esaus fury chaces, And makes him fall to kisses and embraces."
22813,"Looke on my youth, not halfe so loth to die, As to be slaine by brethrens crueltie, Looke on my innocence."
22814,"Behold my teares, Respect your and my Fathers grayer haires: Who cannot but with griefe and sorrow die, For losse of me by Brethrens Butchery."
22815,"neuer hope this murther to conceale, For though you your owne lips should all vp seale, These beasts, stones, trees, my bloud to heau'n will cry For vengeance, on this bloudy Felony: And that which now you thinke in secret done, Shall be made plaine and clearer then the Sunne."
22816,"Now Isaack like I lye vnder your knife, And willingly as he could leaue my Life, Were I perswaded 'twere the heaun'ly will, But herein Satans purpose you fulfill, And your malicious enuy satisfie: But Lord accept me as I guiltiesse die."
22817,"These words proceeding from a Soule opprest With anguish, wrought so in his Brethrens brest, That though they willingly all wish him slaine, Yet each from bloud-shed would his hands retaine."
22818,"Wherefore they him into a dry pit cast, With cold and hunger there to pine and wast, And suddenly they sit them downe to eate, Ne're pitying Ioseph that must sterue for meate: So haue I seene tenne hounds of bloudy kinde, Who long haue chas'd, to kill the harmelesse Hinde; When they haue lodg'd her in the hunters gin, Whence neuer one escapes, if enterd in; Turne to their Lodge, where for their labours meede, They on the heart and bleeding intrailes feede."
22819,"Poore Ioseph had thy Brethren now thee slaine, Thou long since hadst beene rid out of thy paine: But whilst thou seek'st by teares thy life to saue, Thou now art buried quicke within thy graue: What canst thou looke for in this Dungeon vast, But eu'n with cold and hunger here to waste?"
22820,"Depriu'd of Sunnes most comfortable Light, And euill Sp'rits with horrour thee to fright, Yet as a fauour this was done to thee, Thus are the wickeds mercies Crueltie."
22821,"the childe to heau'n cries from the pit, And doth to righteous Iudge his cause commit; Lord thou dost know how innocent I die; Me saue, and pardon their iniquitie."
22822,"As when fierce Caine, (out of base enuying, That God should best accept his offering.)"
22823,"Had Abel slaine; His bloud to heau'n did cry, So this childs grieuous Lamentations flye Into Gods eares, who sends the Ishmaelites, First persecutors of the Israelites: From Brethrens malice Ioseph to set free, And saue his life, though lose his Libertie: So he that late escaped being slaine, Is raised vp out of the pit againe, Whom to be rid off, and for present pay, His Brethren sell to be conueid away."
22824,"And now large shadowes from the Mountaines fall, And Heau'n with his blacke mantle couers all, Phebus for rest in Sea his Steedes bestowes, And from her Sea of rest the Night arose: When Iacobs sonnes amongst themselues deuise To couer their inhumane cruelties: And as we euer see that one foule sinne Begets another, to lye hidden in; As some their foule adultery to hide, Haue first vs'd Drunkennesse, then Homicide; So these vniustly 'gainst their Fathers will, One of the Kiddes then in his Flocke doe kill, And dipping in his blood the colourd coate Of Ioseph, it vnto their father brought, And say; Now see good father dost thou know, Whether this be thy Iosephs coate or no?"
22825,"As Turtle deare, when seeking for her loue, She finds at cu'n the feathers of a Doue, Begoard with blood late party colourd gay, Concluding now her mate hath beene the prey Of cruell hawke, sends out most piteous cries, And in those dearest blooded feathers dies."
22826,"So good old Israel, whose dimmer sight, Could scarce discerne of colours by the night, Yet seeing Iosephs coate begoared red, Which lately was so finely coloured: For whom, though long he look'd, and did enquire, Yet saw nor heard least newes of his retire."
22827,"Cries out, 'tis Iosephs coate with blood defild, Some wicked beast deuoured hath the child."
22828,"I sent him out alone vnwittingly, And therefore guilty of the crueltie."
22829,"So grieuous were his groanes and lamentation, They turne to sorrow all his habitation, And though his sonnes and daughters all arise To comfort him, the best they can deuise, Yet still the good old man doth groane and crie, Ioseph is lost, I in his coate will die."
22830,"He with wilde beasts is into peeces torne, Ile sooner cease to liue, then cease to mourne."
22831,"Father saith Dina then, th'vnlucky maid, Why should you without cause be thus dismaid?"
22832,"Before times I haue often heard you say, Gods Angell you conducted in your way, From hence eu'n vnto the Assyrian plaine, And thence from Laban brought you home againe; Oh why should you despaire then thus and feare, As God of yours had not as great a care?"
22833,"What because here a bloody coate you see, Must it be Iosephs needes?"
22834,"or if it bee, He may, whilst he from cruell beasts did flie, Forsake his coate to scape more speedily: He that this coate found loose vpon the ground, Not any signe of murthering him found, Nor found he either hand, head, foot or bone, Onely this bloody coate lay all alone; Blooded it seemes with iawes of cruell beast, Which on some other prey had made his feast: ""Thus can the whole to sicke good counsell giue, ""And easier 'tis to teach well, then to liue: But Ruben, Iudah, all his sonnes may rise, And daughters all to comfort him deuise, He rends his clothes, puts sacke cloth on his loines, And for his Ioseph long time weepes and pines, And mourning will goe downe vnto his graue To Ioseph, whom he here shall neuer haue."
22835,"Meane while to Nile the Midian merchants hie, Laden with Balme, with mirrhe, and Spicerie, When Ioseph, whom if they could truely prize, Was farre more worth than all their merchandize; Did bondage base vnto his noble minde, More bitter, then death to his body finde; But hauing none to whom to make his mone, Goes sighing, sobbing to himselfe alone, Vntill a merchant willing him to cheare, That hee might fairer looke, and sell more deare, Enquireth of his parents and his kinde, To put more pensiue thoughts out of his mind; Know; saith the gentle childe, my parents came From Heber, whence we Hebrewes haue our name, The fourth from Sem, first of that blessed seede, Th' Almighty chose mankind againe to breede: My Father Iacob who the Birth right bought Of Esau, that Gods Blessing set at nought, Was Isaacks sonne, eu'n Abrams blessed seede, In whom all Nations happinesse may reade."
22836,"My Mother Rachel, now depriu'd of Life, Was Israels first Loue, but second Wife: Laban both Sonne and Father in one night, Deceau'd; of's wife him, me of my Birth right: For when his thoughts in nuptiall Bed embrace My Mother Rachel, Lea's in place: Whereby my Brethren me in yeares surpasse, But I them in my Fathers loue and grace; For enuy hereof, Lo!"

22840,"Good Masters, So must I Now call you, and will serue you chearefully, Tell me what glorious Buildings yonder bee, Whose like in Canaan I did neuer see; Which seeme, except mine eyes me much doe faile, Like to a Citie that on Sea doth saile, Or Noahs Arke which floting on the Floud, Preseru'd all kinde of Creatures with their food."
22841,"Boy, saith a Merchant, This is Egypts Plaine, Where neuer yet did fall a drop of raine; The Waues you see are seu'n-fold headed Niles, Which now doth Ouer-flow the richest soiles, Whence euer Sol by his all quickning heate, Rais'd Corne and Grasse, for Man and Beast to eate: There where you see the Floud like Seas appeare, Will be a Haruest twice within a yeare."
22842,"Beside, no mortall wight could euer wish, Then's there more plenty of most dainty Fish: Abram the Father of great Ishmael, (From whom our Nation) Famine did compell For succour to descend, into this Land, Where he is said to make them vnderstand The Nature of the highest Deitie, Formes, Lawes, and Natures of the Starry skie, And first them taught to measure out their yeare, By Sunnes iust course: For it doth plaine appeare, That they till then the Moone did measure by, VVhich makes them bost of such antiquitie, And reckon in their annuall Computation, Thousands of yeares before the VVorlds Creation: But though he gaue them in all Arts direction, Yet neuer brought they one to such perfection, As that we call Diuine Astronomie: For in this Country best they might descrie, The formes and orders of the Lamps of Night, VVhere neuer Clouds obscure them from their sight."
22843,"First in Caldea Abram learn'd this skill, And grew so well acquainted with Gods will, He knew all things, they say, by Reuelation, Past, present, future, from the VVorlds Creation, Till that last minute that it could expire, VVhich as by Water erst, shall be by Fire."
22844,"Indeed, saith Ioseph, I haue heard it tould, The first man Adam prophecide of ould, The worlds destruction twice, for sinnes iust hire, The one by Water th'other by the Fire, Seth therefore Adams scholler and his sonne, Not knowing which was first: of earth and stone, Two Pillars built; The earth against the fire, The stone to stand 'gainst waters raging ire: Where Arts, which long Experience had obserued, He vnto future ages faire preserued, The earthen pillar perisht in the flood, The stone the waters violence withstood, These Heber finding after published In Syria, where first learning flourished: Till Abram, who herein did all excell, Came downe to Egypt, and as you doe tell, Conuerst with one they called Mercury, Whom, with these Arts, he taught the mystery Of one trine God-head, and the worlds creation, Who read the same vnto their neighbour nation."
22845,"Whence now they are, and shall in time be spred Through all the earthly globe inhabited▪ Thus they discourse, as if they would foretell Of Gentiles all, which after should excell, In Arts and Sciences; which now dispread, As men, through all the earth on which we tread: For as the earth empeopled was below By Adam, so all Arts and Learning flow First from the Hebrews, vnto eu'ry nation, As Rules and Precepts come by obseruation: But now the cittie's towres obscure the skies, And make them hold their tongues, and vse their eyes The splendor of those buildings to behold, Where they the second time good Ioseph sold."

22848,"NEuer did Adam more lament and plaine, For Abel, by his cruell Brother slaine, Then Iacob mourn'd for fairest Rachels Seede, Nor would by any meanes be comforted: All Day the field his Lamentations heares, All Night his Couch he watreth with his teares: And if least slumber close his blubbring eyes, Him thinkes he sees a cruell Beare surprize His dearest Ioseph; crying out for aid, And starting vp, awakes, much more afraid, His Spirit's thus spent, his Body wearied, With groanes, and tossing vp and downe his Bed: Loe, aged Isaack, who had long beene blinde Of's fleshly eyes, but yet of clearer minde, Comes to his comfort, being thither led By Beniamin, who to him ministred."
22849,"Long stood he mute, and to the grieuous moanes Of his blist Iacob, ecchoed with groanes, Till's heart with sorrow ready now to breake, With words all weight, he thus begins to speake."
22850,"Deare Sonne, the staffe and comfort of mine age▪ The blessed fruit of holy Marriage, Far more to Mee, then to thee Ioseph deare, Mine only Sonne, by Promise, But thou here Hast Beniamin, by thy beloued wife, Faire Rachel, whilst she liu'd thy Ioy and Life: Not that I Ioseph dead or lost doe feare, God that of mee and Abram had such care, Hath no lesse of thee and thy blest seede, In which all happinesse is promised."
22851,"And if of all, of him especially VVho is the chiefe of all thy Family: To whom the Sunne the Moone and Starres must fall, VVhose Sheafe his brethrens Sheafs must worship all, Of these two dreames I was a due obseruer, And reade thence he shall be a great preseruer, A figure of that Sauiour great, which shall Himselfe by losing saue himselfe and all."
22852,"Thus was I once lost to my faithfull sire, VVhen on the Altar kindled was the fire, The knife was ready lift vp by his hand, To sacrifice my Life at Gods command: Thus thou as lost, for more then thrice seuen yeares, Revail'd wert by mine and Rebeccas teares, VVhen Esaus wrath thee draue to Siria plaine, But God Almightie brought thee home againe: And I presage before the reuolution Of thrise seu'n yeares, God will the whole solution of Iosephs dreames with Ioy to thee vnfold, VVhich shall reuiue thy spirit then being old: Before great Blessings God doth Crosses send, That we may on his Prouidence attend, And see the riches of his grace more cleare, VVhich hardlier here obtain'd, we hold more deare▪ Thus Isaac doth interpret Visions darke, As great Mathuselah at building th'Arke, VVho liu'd vntill the yeare of th' inundation, As plaine appeares by Ages Computation."
22853,"Good Israel was wonderfully mou'd At sight of those, he reuerenc'd so and lou'd, His Beniamin but newly taught to stride, Of his blinde Grandsires steppes then being guide, Both which seem'd two good Angels to him sent From heau'n, to ease his griefe and discontent: VVherefore soone rising on his wearie bed, Hauing his Father duly honoured, He answers with a piteous sigh and grone, Ioseph is gone, and I am left alone: Deare Rachels first borne, whom to make my wife, I was a seruant best part of my Life."
22854,"After we had beene maryed foureteene yeares, Rachel and I, with Prayers, Vowes, and teares, Begg'd him of God: Then did my yeares expire, VVhich Laban for my two wiues me did hire: One daughter and tenne sonnes I had before, By Leah seu'n, and by my Handmaids foure, But I my Ioseph priz'd them all aboue, As I his Mother more then theirs did loue: And though I churlish did mine Vncle finde, In many things herein he was most kinde, To pay me wages ere my worke was done; For I had Rachel ere that I begun My first yeares Seruice, whereby seu'n yeares seem'd But a few daies, so I her loue esteem'd: No man had euer more experience Then I of Gods good grace and Prouidence, VVhen I was first to Padan Aram sent, I only with my staffe forth from thee went To Bethel, where th'Almightie Lord to mee Appear'd by Vision, promising to bee My God, and to my Seede the Land to giue, Whereon I slept; which firmely I beleeue."
22855,"Then did I vow, so he would me protect Safe in my Iourney, and my wayes direct, Giuing me Bread to eate, and Clothes to weare, The Tenth of all I had, to offer there: God gaue my asking, and abundance more, So as I thence return'd with stocke, and store: And though I long forbare my Vow to pay, God neuer me forgot, vnto this day."
22856,"I confident, beyond all hope, can proue I him shall see againe, whom so I loue, At the last day: till then, hee's dead, and gone, No hope before of Resurrection."
22857,"This is his colour'd Coat, begored red By Iawes of Beasts, which on his Carkasse fed."
22858,"Were I now blinde, I happy were, then could I not this dismall spectacle behold."
22859,"But if, saith Isaack, he hath chang'd his Tent For heau'nly home, why should you thus lament, As without hope?"
22860,"since now he is at rest, Let likewise the remembrance of him rest."
22861,"Weepe you, because your losse turnes to his gaine?"
22862,Your mourning cannot bring him back againe.
22863,"God, our chiefe comforts oft from vs doth rend, Lest we too much on outward meanes depend."
22864,"It may be, you your loue so on him set, You thereby did your loue to God forget: Then's Iustice iustly him from you hath rent, And Mercy giues you cause now to repent."
22865,"But whether Ioseph liuing be, or dead, Let little Beniamin stand in his stead: What your affection so to him enclin'd, You eu'n the same in Beniamin shall find, Of Rachel both begot in marriage bed, Only this last she neuer suckeled, For in the paines of Birth she left her life, Thus he a tender nurse lost, thou a wife: This Isaacks rubbing on an ancient sore, Made Israel lament more then before; So as the childe who still was standing by, To heare such mourning weepes for company: And as a Parret, newly taught to prate, The voice doth of another imitate, So cryes the Boy; good Father, Ioseph's gone, And I alas!"
22866,here left am all alone.
22867,"T'is this fine colour'd coat he wont to weare, Good father let vs it to Ioseph beare, (For that was euer vnder Iacobs arme) He may haue neede thereof to keepe him warme."
22868,"These pleasant reasons from the witty child, Old Iacob of his sorrowes so beguil'd, He was content a while his heart to ease, The better this his dearest Boy to please."
22869,"And since he Ioseph thought dead, and at rest By little he his Lamentations ceast, But euer little Beniamin would cry, To let him goe to Ioseph by and by."
22870,"My Boy saith Iacob, if that thou wilt goe To Ioseph, thou must first as Ioseph doe, Be a good Boy, serue God, thy prayers say At Morne, at Night, and oftentimes a day: All lying, swearing, idle talke forbeare, Duly obey and serue thy Parents deare, To any, nor of any speake least ill, And alwaies be obedient to Gods will: For so did Ioseph, therefore I had giu'n Him this fine colour'd coat, But now in heau'n He is most gloriously by God arraid, And sees all Ioyes and Pleasures can be said."
22871,"By this the Boy to imitate growes faine, Ioseph in all, for hope of Iosephs gaine; If Iacob any thing would haue him doe, Say Ioseph did it, he would doe it too, If he from any ill would him retaine, Say Ioseph would not do't, he would refraine: All which he so well ordered, that in fine, The Boy was measur'd all by Iosephs Line, And Iacob so delighted therewithall, He leaues his couch and comes downe to the Hall, Where euer Beniamin his darling deare, Was ready with his pratling him to cheare, Till in the end his loue so on him set, Makes him all griefe for Iosephs losse forget: And pleasure take in Beniamin now more, Then he in Ioseph euer did before."
22872,"So doth one for his wife oft weepe and crie, As, after her, he would not liue but die, Forbeares his meat, till time of mourning past, Then cheares his spirits, and fals to his repast, And suddenly a second mariage proues, Whome he more dearely then the former loues, And so his deare affection on her sets, He all his former sorrowes quite forgets."
22873,"Thus liu'd old Iacob many happy yeares With Beniamin, but wisely he forbeares Him to aduenture once out of his sight, Lest as good Ioseph him befall it might."
22874,"Twelue times through all the Signes the Sunne had past, And now through Gemini was making hast, When he more kindly on his Paramore The Earth did shine, then euer heretofore: Which made the superstitious Cananite Adore this Planet, as a God of might, And by Religion of his owne deuising, To worship the Sunne-setting, well as rising."
22875,"And amongst other their Inuentions vaine, Dan Phoebus to leaue Delos Ile they faine, To court the Nimph of Iordane for his Bride, And her to honour with his fertile side."
22876,"Therefore her Bankes he richly doth adorne, And Hills and Valleyes fills so thicke with Corne, The eared Lands seeme a continued plaine, VVhose eares of Corne stoope to the ground againe, And she proud of the honour of his rayes, Her bosome all with fragrant flowres begayes, The more him with sweet sauours to delight, And seeme more faire embellisht in his sight: VVhich made the Hills and Dales to laugh and sing▪ And all the Birds with sweetest warbeling, VVith them to tune sweet ditties to his praise, VVhose heat and Light diuides the night from daies."
22877,"Seu'n times this Gyant his full course had run, And ended, where his trauell he begun, VVhilst Iordans Nimph continues in his grace, VVhich Canaan made the happyest fruitfull place Of all the Regions, where Sunnes fertile heate, Doth cause the Laborer with Ioy to sweate▪ But as we alwaies after Drowth see Raine, Warre after Peace, and after Pleasure Paine; So after plenteous and fruitfull yeares, Great famine, want, and scarcitie appeares In Canaans Land: For seu'n yeares being past Of Plenty; Famine all the world doth wast."
22878,"Therefore, they that of late Sols mariage fain'd, Now of his wrath and Iealousie complain'd, That he which with his Beames late cherished All fruits, the Earth in fruitfull bosome bred, Was so inflam'd with Iealousie and Ire, As if he all the Earth would set on fire: So as he either would her seedes not daigne To quicken, or if that the hopefull graine Promis'd a fruitfull haruest at the last, He in his fury all would burne or blast, Thus did those heathen of Gods wonders fable, And vainly construe his workes admirable."
22879,"But good old Israel who, like Lilly-white Amongst the thornes, fear'd God and did vpright, The glory they did to the Creature giue, Gaue the Creator, who doth euer liue, And looking to the Author of this store, For this his greater plenty, honours more."
22880,"And takes the Famine for a Chastisement To man for sinne, that so he might repent."
22881,"But as the plenteous store did nothing breede But Pride and Follies vaine in Canaans seede, (Excessiue rioting, Lust, Drunkennesse, Amongst the rich: Nicenesse and Idlenesse Amongst the poore: who swinishly eu'n all The Acornes eate, but looke not whence they fall, Consuming all the Corne their land them beares, Not laying vp least store for dearer yeares, But loathing and despising courser graine, Transport it as superfluous for their gaine, So when the Earth denide like store to bring All fall to grudging and to murmuring, And Sol whom, they so honourd at the first For his high fauours, for his Fury curst: And those which late so plenteously were fed In the first yeare, are like to sterue for bread."
22882,"Yea holy Iacob though he were exempt From Canaans sinnes, yet in their punishment Doth beare his share, and now for want of Bread He feares the ruine of himselfe and seede."
22883,"And though he sole relyeth on Gods grace, Of which he had good tryall in like case, Neglects no meanes to make supply of store▪ But thus bespeakes his sonnes, I heretofore, When plenty in your fields did so abound, Wisht that a man amongst you might be found, Who wisely would for future wants prouide, But folly tis for Had I wist to chide, We heare ther's store of Corne in Egypt land, Yet one doth gaping on another stand; Oh hast you thither Bread from thence to buy, To saue aliue vs and our Family."
22884,"The brethren ten, (for Iacob would not send Downe Beniamin with them) do soone descend To Egypt, where neare Memphis on the way A graue old Sage they ouertake in gray, Who seem'd by his graue gestures and his motions, To be a Hermit, now at his deuotions."
22885,"As Isaacke going out one Eu▪n to pray, Seeing his seruant lighting on the way, With faire Rebecca vaild, and all her traine, Left his deuotions them to entertaine; Eu'n so this Sage, whose eyes on heauen were plast, As they would thither ere his body hast, Seeing these gentle strangers there alight, And him to mutuall courtesie inuite, Leaues his deuotions, and of them enquires, (Knowing they Hebrewes were by their attires) In their owne language, what, and whence they are, Which true and plainly they to him declare: And farther tell him that a famine sore Had now consum'd their Corne and all their store, Compelling them from Canaan to goe downe To Egypt, where they knew none, nor were knowne."
22886,"Therefore saith Ruben, may we you request Vs strangers to informe, as you may best, Of your condition first, next of your king, Your countrey, and your forme of gouerning: And if, as Fame reports, here's store of graine, And how and where we may the same obtaine, For here, eu'n as at home, we see all wast, No future haruest, nor least signe of Past, And therefore with my brethren I desire To know the cause of what we so admire, Without a Seed-time or a Haruest, Plentie."
22887,"And Garners full, although the fields be emptie."
22888,"Brethren said Trismegist, for so he hight, I first must here lay open to your sight, That Being's his goodnesse Power and Prouidence: By which we all haue Motion, Being, Sense, Who, the first cause of all, doth things dispose By Second, these we see, that keepes he close: I am a Priests and Princes eldest sonne, For Priests and Princes are in Egypt one, And to the Sunne, as was our countrey guize, Was consecrate to offer Sacrifice, Great Trismegistus was mine ancester, A King, a Priest, and a Philosopher: Soone as my Tongue mens words could imitate, And, though with little vnderstanding, prate, My parents me instruct to learne by heart The rules of Wisedome, and the lawes of Art, The aspects of the Starres, their seuerall wayes, Coniunctions, Orders, Interposings, Stayes, Flying of Birds, Beasts intrailes, and in fine, All that might make with them a sound Diuine."
22889,"And well I profited, for ere least haire Of Siluer, with my Golden did appeare, The wisest, I of all my Peeres was deem'd, And most in Temple and in Court esteem'd: Could best of all expound the hardest Theames, Tell men their Fortunes, and interpret Dreames: Thus I the Oracle was many a yeare Of Egypt, and of all the Countries neare; Till that high Wisdome which things future knowes As present, Them by Dreames to Pharoh showes."
22890,"Fast by a Riuer side him thought he stood, Whence came vp seu'n fat Kine, well flesht and good, And other seu'n ill-fauour'd Leane, that houre Came vp, and all the faire ones did deuoure: Againe, he slept, and saw seu'n eares of Corne On one root, well-set, ranke, and goodly borne, Which seuen thin blasted, spoild and eate vp cleane, Then Pharoh wak'd, and lo!"
22891,it was a dreame.
22892,"The Morning come, and he sore troubeled, His Sonthsayers are all assembeled, Pharoh thereof to vs makes declaration, But not a man can giue th'interpretation▪ Our Spheres, Spels, Circles, Birdes, nor Sorceries Had power to discerne these Mysteries: Then Pharoh mou'd, and thenceforth grieuing sore, Forbeares his meate, and comes abroad no more: Vntill his Butler, rais'd againe to grace, Who had forgot his friend in wretched case, Till twice twelue times the Moon with borrowed light, Had fill'd her hornes (for friends once out of sight, Are eu'n as soone out of a Courtiers minde, ""Such Curtesie in Court most Schollers finde): Thus said to Pharoh, Sir you cannot yet Chuse but remember, how you did commit Me and your Baker to your Stewards ward, For some misdeeds, which you of vs had heard: Where in the Prison we a young man found, In whom diuinest wisedome did abound, For we a seuerall Dreame had in a night, Which told to him, to vs he read aright; The Baker to the Gallowes, I to Grace Should be restor'd, and all in three dayes space: This of our Dreames th'interpretation was, All which you saw most truely came to passe."
22893,"Thus ends the Butler: Pharaoh glad to heare Of ought might ease his longing, wishd him there, Who quickly sent for, shau'd, appareld white, As him became to stand in Pharohs sight, Heard, and as soone his Dreame did right expound, Which by nine yeares experience true is found."
22894,"For these  He did interpret seu'n fat fruitfull yeares, The seu'n thin sterued which did them deuower, Seu'n yeares of famine▪ In a lucky hower For Egypt: for thus store we vp did lay In fruitfull yeares, against this euill day: And not sole happy for our temporall store, But spirituall: For many who before (Long led in ignorance and errour blind, Till they Gods Truth by good experience find) To stones and stockes, Sunne, Moone, and Starres did fall Now worship God the maker of vs all: Of which, for euer (blessed be his name) A thankfull one I, though th'vnworthiest, am."
22895,"And hauing all vaine worldly ioyes forsaken, Now to deuotion sole my selfe betaken."
22896,"Thus ends the Sage: When Iudah, holy Sire, Hearing thy words, Gods goodnesse we admire, Happy that God hath kindled in thy breast, The holy Fire these flames doe manifest: But tell vs what became of that great Sage Which of such store and famine did presage: You told vs how the Butler him neglected, But how hath Pharoh his desert respected?"
22897,"For great ones, for the most part, doe despise The poore, though they be ne're so iust and wise: And though the Land is by their wisedomes guarded, They are not long respected or rewarded."
22898,"That's th'end, saith Trismegist, for which I told The rest."
22899,"When as King Pharoh did behold Such heaun'ly wisedome, in such youthfull yeares, (For scarce six Lustres in his face appeares,) Who counsell'd him with speede for to prouide, A man of vnderstanding, that might guide His vnder Officers, through all the Land, To store vp plenty vnder Pharohs hand: The fifth part e'un of all their Corne and seede, To feede his people in the time of neede: The saying seem'd so good in Pharohs eyes, And all his Seruants, that they soone deuise, (Because no man in Egypt could be found, In whom the Spirit of God did so abound) To place him ouer all his house and Land, That all might be eu'n as he should command, Thus now he with the King is all as one, He only sits aboue him in his Throne, Him then most sumptuously apparelling, He made the Lord and Keeper of his Ring, The which he vsed, as the publique Seale, For all his priuate state and Common-weale: And his second Charet brauely plac'd, And with the highest princely honour grac'd: This is the Man hath stor'd vp in the Land Great heapes of Corne, in number like the Sand: For as the Sands cannot be numbered, No more the Plenty he hath gathered."
22900,"Now twice the Sunne hath his full course nigh past, Since all our Lands haue barren lien and wast; Nilus no more our Fields hath watered, Nor fertile dewes our fruits haue cherished: And now the dearth in all the Land is sore, As well amongst the Richest as the Poore; The Garners open'd are, and thence is sold Great store of Corne; Nor doth this Prince withhold From strangers his Prouision; For well-ny All Regions hether come them Corne to buy: This man will you for Money Corne afford, For he's wise, gentle, iust, and feares the Lord: But, whilst the Sage to them this tale relates, They vnawares approach neere Memphis gates, Then to his Cell returnes the aged Sire, They hast into the Citie to enquire More of that Prince, by whom the Corne was sold, Where they their Brother though vnknowne, behold."
22901,The end of the second Booke of Ioseph.
22902,THE THIRD BOOKE OF IOSEPH.
22903,"NOw is the time that all the Sheaues must bend To one, now rais'd on high vpon his end, The Sunne, Moone, & Starres eleuen must now To him they meanely erst accounted, bow."
22904,"For Ioseph now by due desert and right, Is plac'd in honours Chariot shining bright, And all the Corne, the Treasure of the Land, Vnder his sole disposing and Command: For this same Ioseph which the Hebrewes sold, Is he of whom great Trismegist erst told: Who Corne had heap'd vp numberlesse like sand, And was the Ruler ouer Egypts land, When lo!"
22905,"the brethren tenne before him brought, Low bowing to the ground, him thus besought: Great Lord!"
22906,"whose wisdome and deserued grace Giue's thee in Egypt eu'n the second place, Whose Prudence, honour, glory and renowne, Through all the habitable Earth is knowne, Vouchsafe to vs thy Seruants now such grace, As thou hast done to many in our Case: We Brethren all, one mans Sonnes, come to buy Corne to releeue vs and our Family, Except we by thy Clemencie be fedde, We and our Race must die for want of Bread."
22907,"The Lord of Egypt then who them did know, But was vnknown, Himself strange rough doth show, And now remembring well his Dreames of late, For which these, that thus honour, him did hate, Thus answers: See!"
22908,"you haue a faire pretence, To buy you Corne and Victuall from hence; But you are come into the Land as Spies, To see wherein our strength and weakenesse lies: I'st like ten Brethren should so farre descend?"
22909,"None left at home their houses to defend, Or are you all without a house or home, And masterlesse about the Countrie rome?"
22910,"Truly, saith Iudah, we twelue Brethren bee."
22911,"All one mans sonnes, of which thou ten dost see, The least, at home, doth with his Father stay, But no man knowes, where th'other is this day: To buy foode are thy Seruants hither come, For vs and for our Families at home: By this, saith then the Prince, the truth I'le know, Whether you, as I say, be Spyes or no: For, by the life of Pharoh, no man home Shall goe, before your younger Brother come: Take them to Prison, till his comming tryes The truth: By Pharohs life you are but Spyes."
22912,"Then he three dayes committeth them to ward, Whilst of an answer they themselues prepar'd."
22913,"Thus, as Gods Minister and Substitute, He vengeance on their sinnes doth retribute, Sinnes now forgot, because so long since past, But though God's slow, he payes them home at last: Yea then, when they themselues thinke most secure For Iosephs wrongs, he pay's them home and sure."
22914,"Happy who make right vse of Chastisement, Which is to hate, forsake Sinne, and repent: But, they in Prison, Ioseph doth aduise Alone with God, how he may best deuise, Them for their foule offences to correct, And yet his aged Father not neglect, Whom faine he would releeue with store of graine, But feares his Brethren will not come againe."
22915,"The third day therefore, thus saith Ioseph, heare, Doe this and liue; for I the Lord doe feare: If you be true men, as you all affirme, Leaue one man bound, the rest all home returne, With Corne for to releeue your Family, Then bring your brother, And not one shall dye, But traffique here as true men in the Land, And I will free your Hostage from his Band."
22916,"His word preuail'd, But they in conscience Prickt for their cruelty, and foule offence, Long since committed 'gainst this Lord vnknowne, And thinking God now payes them with their owne, Thus one to other to complaine begin; Ah!"
22917,"how did we against our Brother sinne, When his Soules anguish did to vs appeare, And he besought vs, yet we would not heare: Therefore on vs, this trouble now doth fall, When Ruben thus; oh!"
22918,"did I not you all Not to offend against the Lad desire, And now you see God doth his bloud require: Little thinke they that Ioseph by doth stand, And all their speeches plainly vnderstand, Who turnes and weepes, yet soone returnes againe, So Friends afflictions teares from friends constraine."
22919,Then taking Simeon he him binds with bands Before their eyes: And secretly commands.
22920,"To fill their Sackes with Prouender and Graine, And put their Money in their Sackes againe: So they returne with Conscience tiring more, Then all the Miles from Nile to Iordanes shore, As when tenne horse men rouing out for prey, Lose one of their deare fellowes by the way, Though with rich Spoiles they to the campe returne, All for him lost, lift vp their voice and mourne; So mourne these Brethren nine for Simeons chaine, Their brothers losse was greater then their gaine: But when Gad in the Inne his Sacke vnbindes For Prouender, and there his money findes, Their hearts them failing, all are sore affraid, That they as Simeon likewise were betraid: Ah!"
22921,"What, say they, hath God vpon vs brought For all the wickednesse which we haue wrought?"
22922,"This thing vpon vs all is iustly come, But most especially on Simeon: Who was the cruellest, and rather would Haue Ioseph slaine; then to the Merchants sold: But when at home they to their Father tell All that to them in Egypt had befell: And how that they for Spyes were taken there, Imprisoned three dayes, and put in feare; And that the Man there still kept Simeon bound, Till by inquirie all the Truth he found: And seeing also eu'ry man bring backe The money, which he carryed, in his Sacke: The good old man was wondrously affraid, That Simeon eu'n as Ioseph was betraide: And said, my sonnes you laugh mine age to scorne, You haue my Simeon pawn'd or sold for Corne, Else where should you prouide such store of graine, And yet bring all your Moneys home againe?"
22923,"But when they farther told him in a word, How rough and sterne they found th' Egyptian Lord▪ And that their bringing Beniamin must trye, Whether or no they came the Land to Spy; He thinkes they likewise seeke him to depriue Of Beniamin, his dearest sonne aliue: Wherefore he thus Laments and makes great mone, His brother's dead, and he is left alone; If mischiefe him befall vpon the way, You bring my head to graue with sorrow gray: The Dearth grows great, Corn's spent, Iacob in vaine Them bids for foode to Egypt hast againe; We dare not see, say they, the Princes face, Except our youngest Brother be in place: We straight will goe, so him with vs thou send."
22924,"saith Iacob, what did you intend, By telling of the man you had a brother?"
22925,"Alas, saith Iudah, how could we doe other?"
22926,"He of our state and kindred did inquire, Saying, what liueth yet your aged Sire?"
22927,Haue you a Brother yet?
22928,"we told him so, Ah!"
22929,how could we what he intended know?
22930,"But send the Lad with vs, we instantly Will bring you food for all your Family: I am his surety, him of me require, For euer let me beare thy blame and ire, Except I bring him backe: The fault is thine, Else we returned had the second time."
22931,"Father, saith Ruben, let my Sonnes be slaine, Except I safe doe bring him home againe."
22932,"As in some Siege when Famine growes so great, That Mothers their owne children deare doe eat, One close her dearest Darling vp doth hide, Lest others her compell it to diuide, And rather chooseth eu'n to sterue and pine, Then cleaue her tender infant in the Chine: So when the Famine now growes grieuous sore In Iacobs house, and like still to be more, He steruing rather chooseth to abide, Then part with his deare darling from his side; But when he saw himselfe, and all his race With dearest Beniamin, in equall case, That all for want of Bread must sterue and dy, Except from Egypt they had new supply; He said to them: Since needes it must be so, A present of my hands take ere you goe, Balme, Spice, and Myrrhe with best fruits of the land, Take likewise double money in your hand, And that brought backe returne, as it is right, It may be it was but some ouer-sight, And take your Brother with you, and arise, God send you fauour in the Princes eyes."
22933,"To free my Simeon, and this my delight, Thus of my Children I am robbed quite: With that he poured out a floud of teares, But hungry Stomackes had nor eyes nor eares, But tooke the Spice and money in their hand, And haste with Beniamin to Egypts Land, From Hebron, three dayes Iourney, passe they right To Memphis, where they lodged all that night, Early 'n the morning, when as Ioseph sate, Dispatching Suitors and affaires of State, Amongst the other suitors in the Hall, He first one of his Brethren spyes, then all; But most his dearest Beniamin he ei'd, And therefore bids his Steward soone prouide, And take those Hebrewes to some priuate roome, For he would haue them dine with him at noone: 'Tis fit that those whom God to Place doth call, Should be to strangers kind and hospitall."
22934,"Then brought to Iosephs house, they are affraid, The money to their charges should be laid."
22935,"When Iudah thus: The money we did finde In our Sacks mouths, when we did them vnbinde, We haue brought backe, with money eke to buy New Corne for vs, and all our Family: Peace, saith the Man, your Father's God you sent That treasure, I was paid and well content."
22936,"And forth-with Simeon out vnto them brought, Who each saluting other, as they ought, Enquire at first of one anothers wealth, But Simeon chiefly of his Fathers health: Then are they to a stately Parlour brought, All hang'd with curious Arras richly wrought By Iosephs Bride, To whom he had made knowne His Kindred, there in curious colours showne, (For, as her Lord, so she no time mispends, But duely with her Maides, her worke intends: Lo!"
22937,"Ioseph is the Paterne of her life, Thus a good Husband alwaies makes a wise): The Deluge in the first peece was contain'd, Where, but the Arke, nought on the flouds remain'd, But they abated, Lo!"
22938,"there commeth forth, All liuing ceeeping things vpon the earth, With such varietie and cunning wrought, As plainer folkes them liuing would haue thought, So skilfull Art doth Nature imitate, The Dogges doe seeme to runne, the Lambs to bleate▪ Here Noah offreth on an Altar built, Of all cleane Beasts to cleanse sinnes foulest guilt; Good Sem, Arphaxad, Selah (of whose race Came Heber, whence the Hebrewes) next had place, And Pelag next, who first diuides the Land, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Tarah next doe stand, From whence comes blessed Abraham, by whom The blessed Seede of Sarahs wombe should come: Here Angels him salute, with God he walkes, And as two friends with God familiar talkes, Here Sarah laughs to heare from her dry wombe, Seede like Sea sands, all numberlesse, should come: Here Isaack's Circumcis'd, Here sacrific'd By Faith, but for his bloud a Lambe suffic'd: Rebecca skins on Iacobs hands here cleaues, Here's Brother of his Blessing he deceaues: And blessed, straight flyes from his brothers wrath To Laban, where he both his daughters hath: Here he returnes, whom soone as Laban misses, With anger he pursues, but parts with kisses: Here wrestles he with God, lo here he meetes His angry brother, who him kindly greetes: Before one Sheafe, here ten Sheaues seeme to fall, Here Sunne, and Moone, and Starres, it worship all; Here are ten Brethren playing in the shadowes, Whilst all their flockes are mowing of the Meadows, Like liuely Shepheards all doe dance and sing, That Woods and Hils with Ecchos seeme to ring: When comes a Childe in party-colourd Coat, Them to salute, but all flye to his Throat, And like so many Butchers 'bout a Lamb, Seeke to bereaue him from his dearest Dam, Of all the stories they did there behold, This had most life."
22939,"For Iosephs wife had told, With her owne hands, it here so cunningly, A man would thinke he saw the Picture cry, And on his knees with vnfeign'd Innocence, To begge his Life of their Maleuolence."
22940,"This made their eyes those curious sights forbeare, And gastly one vpon another stare, And so amaz'd them, they now surely thought, God all their wickednesse to light had brought: But now that Ioseph is return'd they heare, Therefore their Present ready they prepare."
22941,"As Abram when he had recouered His Kinsman Lot, and Captiues with him led, Returning by the way with Bread and Wine, Was met by great Melchizedek diuine, And blessed, for that God now by his hand Had sau'd the Prince and People of the Land; Eu'n so good Ioseph who by paines, not sword, Had sau'd aliue th'Egyptians and their Lord, And daily from fierce Famine succored Such as had died else for want of Bread, Was met with Presents comming to his Hall, And blest as the Preseruer of them all."
22942,"Amongst the rest these Hebrewes louting low Their Present offer him, who straight would know, How they did all, and if their Father old Liu'd still in health, of whom they last him told: And what is this your Brother young, said he, Of whom you told mee?"
22943,They all answer'd yea.
22944,"God blesse my sonne, saith Ioseph, and retires, To weepe for Ioy, now hauing his desires: But washing's eyes and face, he doth refraine, And to his Brethren soone returnes againe, So calls for meate, he by himselfe alone, Th'Egyptians by themselues are plac'd each one, His brethren by themselues (For Egypts Nation Are ranked as their ages doe require, Which made them this due order all admire; To all then from his Board he messes sends, But fiue to one on Beniamins he spends, Lo thus they all eate, drinke, and made good cheare, Till they had drown'd all sorrow, griefe and care."
22945,"But Ioseph; who amidst his feasts doth minde Those, that abroad for hunger steru'd and pinde; Thinkes of his Father old, and doth command His Steward for to fill, streight out of hand, The Hebrews sacks, so full as they can thrust, And put their moneys in their sacks, as first: And in the youngest's sacke his siluer Cup, So in the morning, e're the Sunne was vp, They with their Camels laden are let go, But e're they thence are gone a mile or two, Vp gets the Steward, and them after hies, Whom ouer-taking, thus aloud he cryes: Ah!"
22946,why haue you rewarded ill for good?
22947,"My Master of his Grace hath giu'n you food, And you his Cup wherein he drinketh wine, And wont to Prophecie and to diuine, Purloined haue, oh it is euill done."
22948,"Good sir, saith Ruben, Thinke not any one Of vs would doe such thing: the money found, Last time, when we our sackes at home vnbound, Was brought to thee againe, most truly told, How should we then or Siluer steale or gold?"
22949,Dye let him wheresoeuer it is found; Wee Bondmen to my Lord for euer bound.
22950,"He saith the Steward, shall be bound, where wee The Cup shall finde, the other shall goe free: Then taking downe their sackes, they doe begin To search from Ruben, eu'n to Beniamin, There was it found, then all their clothes rend, And backe againe vnto the Citie tend."
22951,"As Theefes who by the owner ouer-take, In fresh pursuit, with goods about them take And brought before the Iudge, all mercy cry, Without defence, for such their Felony: So they to Ioseph brought; before him fall, And only vnto him for mercy call."
22952,"What haue you done, saith he, know you not, I Am able to diuine and Prophecie?"
22953,"Iudah saith, what shall thy seruants say, Or doe?"
22954,How can we cleare our selues this day?
22955,"God hath made plaine thy seruants wickednesse, We are thy Bondmen all, we must confesse, As likewise he with whom the Cup was found, Nay, God forbid, saith Ioseph; he be bound Who had the Cup, The rest depart in peace To your old Father, haste, why doe you cease."
22956,"My Lord, saith Iudah, we haue no defence, Yet let me speake one word without offence: At our last beeing heere, thou didst inquire Of this our Brother, and our aged Sire, And we, thy seruants, true and plainly told, We haue a Father which is very old, Who also in his age begat our brother, The only childe aliue now of his mother, His Brother's dead, and therefore more belou'd, By this my Lord, then answerd, shall be prou'd The truth of all your sayings, Bring him hither That I may see the Brethren all together: We answerd, if the Lad should but depart From his old Father, It would kill his heart; My Lord repli'd, except he to this place With you returne, forbeare to see my face; We comming home, this to our Father show, Who to buy Corne againe would haue vs goe, But, wee repli'd; except the Lad we place Before the Man, wee may not see his face: Ah!"
22957,"saith our Father, you my sonnes well know That I had by his Mother, onely two, One's dead, and gone, if this away you haue, You bring my head with sorrow to the graue: Now if thou vs vnto my Father send, Without the Lad, on whom his dayes depend, Soone as our Father misseth him he dyes, And we be Authors of his miseries."
22958,"Besides, I suretie for the Lad became, And if I bring him not, must beare the blame: How shall I then my Fathers face behold, Without the Lad be there, except I would Bring on my Fathers house such wrechednesse, As no mans Tongue is able to expresse: With that like Iordanes flouds his teares doe fall, And as he wept, so wept his Brethren all."
22959,"But Ioseph then no longer could refraine, But biddes forbeare, there may not one remaine Within with him, whilst he himselfe declares Vnto his Brethren, with such cryes and teares, That the Egyptians and Pharoh heare His loud laments, and scarcely can forbeare To mourne with him, who kept them all from mour∣ning: But Ioseph to his Brethren soone returning, Saith, I am Ioseph; doth my Father liue?"
22960,"Feare not my Brethren, I you all forgiue."
22961,"As when a King, that he discouer may Some traitrous plot, his body doth array In such an habit, as none can descry Him from one of that close Conspiracy, Till hearing all the Traitours Coniuring, He shewes himselfe to be their Lord and King."
22962,"So that they all stand mute and in a maze, And gastly one vpon another gaze: So stand the ten, one looking on another, To see so high their late betraied Brother: Thus at the last, the wicked men shall hide Their face at sight of him they Crucifide, When on his Throne his glory they behold Like Iosephs, who shall like to him be sold."
22963,"But Beniamin poore harmelesse innocent, After he had endur'd this chastisement, At hearing Iosephs name lifts vp his eyes, And lowder now for Ioy then Sorrow cryes: So shall the innocent at last appeare, To be absolued by their Brother deare."
22964,"Then Ioseph saith, my Brethren all, draw neare, I am your Brother Ioseph, doe not feare, That very Ioseph you to Egypt sold, But be not greeu'd therewith, nor doe it hold A cruell thing; For God me sent before, For to preserue your liues with millions more: This is the second yeare, fiue are behinde, When none shall reape, or mow, or sheaues vp binde, God sent me to preserue your Progeny, And saue you by a great deliuery: Not you, I say, but God me hither sent, And made me here, to your astonishment, Great Pharoh's Father, and giu'n free command Ore all his House, and ouer all his Land, Hast to my Father; Tell him in a word, Thus saith thy Ioseph, God hath made me Lord Of Egypt: Tarry not, but soone come downe, And thou shalt dwell on Goshens fruitfull downe: Thy Children, Childrens children, and thy flocke, Beasts, Asses, Camels, all thy store and stocke: Lo there I sustenance for thee will finde, For those fiue yeares of Famine yet behinde: Your owne eyes see, and Beniamins behold, I all in your owne tongue haue truly told."
22965,"My glory here then to my Father tell, As you haue seene, and hither hast to dwell, So weeping he vpon the necke doth fall Of Beniamin▪ and he on his, so all He kisses, and doth after with them talke, Familiarly, as they together walke."
22966,"As when a Treasure in the earth is found, Fames Trumpet doth it farre and neere resound, So Fame this newes in Pharohs Court doth tell, Which pleased him and all his seruants well: Therefore he thus to Ioseph, out of hand Thy Brethren send with Corne into their Land, To bring their Father and his family, That they may eate my Lands fertilitie."
22967,"Besides, I will my Charrets thou command For to conuey your Father to my Land, With Wiues and Children, let them leaue their stuffe, Egypt shall furnish them with store enough."
22968,"Then Ioseph, hasting them away to send, Peace by the way doth thus to them commend: I will not now things past commemorate, Your griefe and sorrow more to aggrauate: For God hath turn'd your morne of griefe and sadnesse, Vnto a day of Feasting, Ioy, and gladnesse, Yet patiently my louing Counsell heare, And, by your former harmes, learne to beware: Let not that wicked Enuyer of mankinde Breede discords, strifes, or quarrels in your minde, Nor question or dispute one with another, Who's most in fault for selling of your brother: Each of his sinne vnfainedly repent, And giue God glory, who me hither sent, And all the euill you against me thought, Turning to good, this great deliuerance wrought, I send now Charrets by the Kings command, To bring my aged Father to this land: Ten Asses laden all with Egypts good, I likewise send my father for his food: And ten she-Asses lade with corne and bread, That by the way, you may thereof be fed: Changes of Rayment I to each assigne, These fiue my dearest Beniamin are thine; With these three hundred siluer peeces: So He hath his right, yet you no wrong I do."
22969,"Let not your eye, cause I am good, be ill, 'Tis reason good enough to say, I will: Yet Nature may informe you of another, He is my onely brother by my mother."
22970,"Enuy him not, because he in mine eyes Most gracious is, nor shall he you despise."
22971,"Brethren, in loue and amitie combind, Are like small stickes we in a fagot bind: No force them bends, whilst they remaine in one: Disioynd, a child will breake them all alone."
22972,"Hast; Fare-you-well; fall not out by the way W'offend against my Father by your stay, Lo!"
22973,"thus they flie from Nile to Iordans shore, To tell their Father all you heard before."
22974,"Ioseph is yet aliue, saith Iudah, and Is Gouernor of all King Pharohs land: Alas!"
22975,"saith Iacob come you me to flout, Ioseph now liues in heau'n, I make no doubt, He was the Prey long since of cruell beast, I haue his bloody, Coate still in my chest."
22976,"saith Dan, to Gods glory we confesse, (Who hath laid open all our wickednesse) That we our brother out of enuy fold, When we at Dothan pastured our fold, To Ishmaelites, who after for their gaine, In Egypt, where we found him, sold againe: His colourd Coate which doth with thee abide, We dipt in bloud, our fowlest sinne to hide: Lo!"
22977,"now thy sonnes on knees before thee fall, And for this our offence beg pardon all: Ioseph vnaskd, our trespasse did remit, Therefore good father also pardon it."
22978,"As Indian merchant on the sodaine told, His ship is safe arriu'd all lade with gold, Which long since to be cast away he feard, Because he neuer tidings of her heard, First wauers, and it hardly can beleeue, Fearing lest he too sodaine credence giue, But when he sees the Porters bringing in The golden Oare, and Ingots, doth begin For to reuiue: Eu'n so old Israel Misdoubts, when first he heard his children tell Of Iosephs life and glory great at Nile; But when he thus had wauered awhile, And saw the goodly charrets Ioseph sent, To bring him and his houshold from their tent To Egypt; and his dearest Beniamin Confirm'd it all for Truth: Behold within, The old mans spirit doth againe reuiue And cryes with Ioy: Ioseph is yet aliue, God pardon you all your Iniquitie, I will goe downe and see him ere I die."
22979,The end of the third Booke of Ioseph.
22980,THE FOVRTH BOOKE OF IOSEPH.
22981,"NOw Iacobs tents abound with such great store Of corne, which they had wanted heretofore; As if God had heau'n's windows opened, And to his chosen thence had rained bread: Which he as lib'rally participates, Vnto his Neighbours and Confederates Of whom then taking leaue, soone as he might, He to Bersheba iourneyed that night, Full twenty miles; where freed from heathen eyes, He to his God might offer sacrifice, And saith thus to his sonnes: this is the place, Where the Egyptian Agar first found grace, When as Gods Angell made her see the well Which sau'd the life of her and Ishmael."
22982,"Here let vs vp to God an Altar reare For sacrifice: that God which did appeare To Abraham and Isaacke, also may To vs appeare as well vpon our way, And in our Iourney vs direct aright: Then in a Dreame and Vision of the night, When sleepe his bodyes senses seized all, God to his Soule doth Iacob, Iacob, call."
22983,"I am the God vnto thy fathers knowne, Then feare not into Egypt to go downe, For I will goe with thee, and make thee there A mighty people: Therefore do not feare, But they shall come againe: And Iosephs hand Shall close thine eyes in the Egyptian land."
22984,"Then early from Bersheba all arose, And in the Waggons all themselues dispose, (Sixty seu'n which with Ioseph and his sonnes Before in Egypt iust to seu'nty comes) Leauing the high montanous craggy hills Of Pharan, neare th'Arabian rocky shells Vpon their left hand; bend downe, on the right To that which the Egyptian sea is hight, Where a plaine way from thence to Egypt guides Ore Sihor, which from Canaan it diuides By South, as great Euphrates doth diuide Chalde, by North, from Canaans fruitfull side."
22985,"Here Iacob, who doth all occasions take, Gods promise certaine to his sonnes to make, Thus tells them: By this Riuer's is bordered The land God promised to Abrams seede; From this Egyptian Riuer, all the lands 1."
22986,"4.21.Are giu'n vs, eu'n to great Euphrates sands, A King of Iudahs seed one day shall raigne Gen."
22987,"15.18 Ore all from Sihor, to the riuer maine; Sihor on South, shall border Iudahs side, Euphrates, Dan: so sure as God did guide Ioseph to Egypt to prouide vs graine, He to this land will bring vs backe againe: Then by this Prouerbe men shall vnderstand, From Dan vnto Bersheba all the land, Oh how can you incredible this deeme?"
22988,"Who haue in Egypt, Iosephs glory seene; That harder was then this to bring to passe: This promisd, but that neuer hoped was, Then, fording Sihor, they through Kedar past, A countrey barren, sauage, wild and wast, Call'd so of Kedar, sonne of Ishmael: Here Iacob eke occasion seekes to tellGen."
22989,"25.13 Of Gods great goodnesse, them a land to giue, Not fruitlesse, barren, where the dwellers liue, As here, of Couin, Rapine, Theft and spoile, But a most pleasant and well watered soyle, Where plenty both of corne and wine do grow, A land which doth with Milke and Honey flow."
22990,"Besides, what cause haue we our God to praise, Who vs conducts throgh these most dangerous waies, Amidst these Robbers, without feare or dread, As late he at Bersheba promised."
22991,"There was a cittie,Called O∣stracina or Cheres."
22992,"built of costly matter A goodly outside, but it wanted water, Like to a lampe, that shineth faire and bright, But wants the Oyle, that should maintaine the light: Or like some outside gallants complement, That lacks minds inward grace and ornament."
22993,"From Kedar passing towards Casius mount, They vp vnto a goodly citty mount, Where stood a goodly temple dedicate, To Iupiter, thence Casius nominate: Not that huge mount which doth in Syria lie, Which one reports to be neare foure miles high,Plin lib."
22994,"This citty eu'n on Egypts border stands, And is the vtmost of the Hagarian lands."
22995,"Here Iacob grieues at the abhomination Of his neare kindred, and his neighbour nation His vnckle Ishmael, who with him came By Hagar, from the loynes of Abraham, And in his flesh receiu'd the Circumcision, But falne to foulest heathenish superstition."
22996,Oh my deare sonnes!
22997,"beware; I speake to all, How you to foule Idolatry doe fall, Leauing that God, which made the heau'ns alone, To worship Idoles made of wood and stone; And, by religion of mans vaine deuising, Adore Moone, Planets, Starres, Fire and Sun-rising."
22998,"How are we bound, aboue all other nations, To blesse God for our often preseruations!"
22999,"But most for that God vs hath giu'n his light, And chosen vs to worship him aright, This Idole, whom these heathen Casius name, With Hammon Iupiter's the very same, In Canaan worshipt; eu'n that cursed Cham, From whence the Cananites receiue their name, Whom holy Noah in malitious pride, As Ishmael good Isaacke, did deride."
23000,"Now fiue times had Auroras tresses bright Chased away the shadowes of the night, Since Iacob came from Hebron with his traine, And now was iournying on his way againe To Egypt, when thus Ruben doth begin, That place where we last lodged, is the In, Where Gad his money in his sacke did finde, When he for Prouender did it vnbinde, Lo there before vs is the fruitfull downe Of Goshen; there aboue is Ram'sis towne: Not one more pleasant, spacious, fruitfull plaine For pasture is in all the world againe; There Pharohs pleasure is, that we shall keepe Our Camels, Asses, all our flockes and sheepe: Not ten miles thence are those two citties great, Which Pharoh houlds for his Imperiall Seate."
23001,"The one call'd On, Egypt's Metropolis, The other Memphis, whose large circuit is By measure seuenteene miles and more about, But On is three miles larger out of doubt; One with three thousand paces measure may, Betwixt these two huge citties, the midway, There's Iosephs country house, whence to the court He at his ease and pleasure may resort."
23002,"Whether the King lye at his Memphian Bowers, Or in his stately Ons more princely Towers: If God shall guide vs on our Iourney right, Thou mayst see yet thy Iosephs face ere night."
23003,"Then Iacob sends out Iudah, from that place To Ioseph, rightly to direct the face Of Iacob, and of all his sonnes and traine, And hasten backe to bring him word againe."
23004,"Then Ioseph takes his Chariot for to meete, His aged father, and him duely greete: As when good Iacob at Mahanaun met Gods host, in order like an Army set, When Esau threatned his last ouerthrow, So doth the glory of these worthies show, Ios."
23005,"When they do both in Goshens plaine appeare, And each vnto the other draweth neare: Ioseph begins to welcome his great Sire, And Iacob Iosephs glory doth admire, And but they Idol worship both abhorred, They one another surely had adored."
23006,"As when this Iacob after twenty yeares With Laban spent, to Isaacke ould appeares, They each in other wondrously delight, So do these Worthyes two in mutuall sight, Ioseph forgets his honour and his state, And weepes on Iacobs necke, eu'n as he sate, And Israel forgets he was his sonne, And as did Ioseph, would to him haue done."
23007,"Clouds may, not Muses can expresse their teares, So long forbearance mutually endeares Them each to other: but old Israel To Ioseph saith, since I may with thee dwell, And see thee in such great prosperitie, Lo!"
23008,willingly I am content to die.
23009,"So haue I seene a faire and tender Lambe, Purloynd by wicked hand from louing Dam, Long mist, at last, when both do meete againe, With louing Bleatings fill both hills and plaine▪ Iosephus ibidem.Yea so th'old man with ioy was extaside, It wanted little but he there had dide, But pious Ioseph, with great care and paine, By chafing brought him to himselfe againe."
23010,"Both being then in Ioseph's Chariot plast, Iacob begins thus with Gods fauours past: Many all done by Chance and Fortune deeme, And little of Gods Prouidence esteeme, I wish such would in all my life obserue, How all mens actions here Gods purpose serue: It was not Chance made Esau set at nought His birthright, for a messe of Potage bought: Nor the deuise alone of my deare mother, That got my fathers Blessing from my brother; For's anger kindled thus, it forth me driues To Laban, where I children get and wiues."
23011,"'Twas Labans churlishnesse and auarice Inrich'd me, by a new and strange deuice, Colours before his yeaning Ewes to spread, Which made white sheepe bring Lambs discoulered, These he to me for wages did allow, And suddenly they to a number grow."
23012,"The murmuring of Labans sonnes constraine Me with my household to hast home againe, Whom Laban followes with an angry hart, But God vs made good friends before we part."
23013,"Esaus feare at Peniel by night Brought me to wrestle with the Lord of might; Whose blessing so away his fury chases, He turnes his threates to kisses and embraces."
23014,"Simeon and Leui, cruell instruments, From Sichem made me to remoue my tents To Bethel; where my house of Idolls clear'd I vp an Altar to th'Almightie reard; And payd my Tenth as I to him did sweare, When first from Esau's wrath I fled or feare, And saw a Ladder, which from Earth did tend To heau'n, whereby the Angels did descend: Now last thy brethrens enuy spite and hate, By selling thee, haue sau'd my life and state; For but for thee, we all had perished, Amongst the Cananites for want of Bread."
23015,"That God causd all these things, it is most cleare, For in the most he did to me appeare, As late when I to Egypt should descend, Thus all doth on Gods Prouidence depend."
23016,"Long did I thee as dead lament and plaine, And neuer hop'd to see my sonne againe, And so did Isaack thy deare Gransire grieue, But neuer would, that thou wer't dead, beleeue, In God he was so confident and bold, And in the dreames, which thou before hadst told, As if, though blind, he had foreseene this day, But now in heauenly Ioyes he liues for ay."
23017,"Some ten yeares since, him dying in his bed, I and my brother Esau buried."
23018,"my deare sonne, my soule is much delighted, As to relate, eu'n so to heare recited Gods goodnesse, towards his; therefore vnfould How God preseru'd thee since thy brethren sold Thee to the Ishmaelites: for thrice seu'n yeare Are past, since I least newes of thee did heare: Good Iacob had no sooner made an end, But Ioseph was as as ready to commend Gods care and Goodnesse in his preseruation, From all his troubles: in this next narration."
23019,"I know not whether, by their fault or Fate, It oft befalleth great men in the state, Rich, wise and happy in their Princes grace, Comely in body, beautifull in face, To be conioyned to a wanton wife, Which sowreth all the sweetnesse of their life: This was the fault or Fortune of a Peare Of Pharohs, to the King his Master deare; My master Potiphar, who, as I weene, Had in his youth a skilfull Merchant beene, And Stewarded so frugally his owne, That Pharoh wise, to whom all this was knowne, Mad him chiefe steward; they that can hold fast Their owne, their Masters treasure seldome wast."
23020,"He that did by experience vnderstand, How things are hoist vp, bought at second hand, Hearing that Merchants stor'd with spicery, Were come to towne, goes his owne selfe to buy The King his masters, and his owne prouision, ,,Thrift stands not on nice court-like superstition."
23021,"Amongst some other wares then to be sold, A faire young Hebrew lad, he doth behold, Adorn'd and set out in the fairest guise, As horses to be sold at higher prize."
23022,"A price once pitchd, and I by running tride, As some do horses, ere they buy them, ride, Was sold to Potiphar, who for his table Me bought, as we our horses for our stable▪ I of this change was most exceeding glad, For now I ease for paine and trauell had, For hard fare, Good; but as a gratefull minde, Returnes ay thankes, where Benefits they finde, So did I my good Lords munificence Requite with Industry and diligence: And for I found he pleasd my Master best, That pleasd my Mistresse well; aboue the rest, I to obserue her was most diligent, And all means vsde to giue her best content: So that by Prudence more then taking paine, I both their Loues and Fauours sought to gaine."
23023,"For who so will obserue, shall euer find Best way to please▪ is to obserue the mind And the affection of men of state, And thereunto themselues accommodate: Therefore a blisse on good men to attend, But misery on wicked to depend, Both prou'd by me, who, for my seruice true, Was by my Lord preferd to honour due, And for like seruice to my wicked dame, Was brought to prison, obloquy and shame."
23024,"This my faire Mistresse, (for no other name I giue her willing, ay to hide her shame,) Some meane mechaniques daughter seemes to be, First matcht in her owne order and degree, But raisd to wealth and honour from the dust, Thinks all to little for her Pride and Lust: And as a man that stands on steeple high, His equals erst doth now like Crowes descry, So she now clambred vp on honours Spire, Thinkes all to low her greatnesse to admire."
23025,"Soone might I in her scornfull lookes descry Her haughtinesse, and my base slauery, But bearing then an honest gentle minde, Omit no seruice that may fauour finde, Which so succeedes, that ere the Crescent bright Had fild her hornes with brothers borrowed light, I by my diligence of her did gaine Sweet smiling lookes, in stead of proud disdaine."
23026,"And now the enuious spirit, which sought of late To ruine by my Fathers loue, my state, Me by my Mistresse lust seekes to intrappe, And dandle in vile sinfull pleasures lappe."
23027,"Damnd  And those pure warming flames from heau'n aboue, Which so true louers hearts in one vnite, That they enioy, without offence, delight: Therefore true loue, like morne is faire and bright; Lust like an Ympe begot of blackest night; But later dayes, since Rapines did abound, Do Lust and Loue most wickedly confound▪ This baser Lustfull Loue the Spirit did chuse (As he did first the Serpent to abuse The weaker Eue) this proudest dame to traine To tast the fruit forbidden by deaths paine, And kindling in her eyes first lustfull fire, This Sense presents it with her foule desire To Reasons brighter eye, which soone that flame Makes to returne into her cheekes, with shame."
23028,"Reason with this base Passion striued long, Put one weake, as the other groweth strong: But nought so checks her Pride and courage braue, As stooping to an hated Hebrew slaue: That she who now did sit in highest grace, Should thus her honour great and state debase, As to become a vassall to her slaue, Pride many womens chastities doth saue."
23029,"But now the violence of lustfull flame Had sear'd the Reason of th'Egyptian Dame, Who waiting till her Lord to Court was gone, Thus, smiling, set vpon me all alone."
23030,"Faire Hebrews sonne, whose equall neuer I Yet saw, nor do I thinke Sols searching eye In all his trauels from the East to West, A Beautie sees with thine fit to contest, Not that hereby I vnderprize mine owne, Mine no Superiour, Thine hath neuer knowne An equall, and though Fates vs vp did reare In sundry Climates, yet since now appeare, In one Horison, Sunnes so equall bright, Let's each on other shine with mutuall light, Let thy bright Beames vpon my Beautie shine, I on thee will reflect both thine and mine: Deare seruant, do not thou my grace despise, Thee I alone can make to honour rise, Thou seest how Potiphar alone doth stand In Pharohs grace, and rules both Court and Land."
23031,"To the I loue, I dare be bold to say, I Potiphar, the Court and Kingdome sway: See then thy happinesse, a slaue of late, In me to rule all Egypts glorious state: And if the Fates vs send a lucky heire, Which may like to his Parents seeme most faire, All hearts he by thy Beautie shall command, And by my right inherit all our land: Sweet Ioseph, let not frownings cloud thy face, Soure lookes thy glorious Beautie do disgrace."
23032,"Let's take th'occasion now we are alone, As Bodyes so our soules to ioyne in one."
23033,"So may we with good likelyhood suppose Bright Phebus with faire Cynthia to close, When ioyning for their mutuall delight, They seeme eclipsed to the vulgars sight."
23034,"As when some lustfull Prince alone, vnseene, Doth tempt the faithfull handmaid of his queene▪ To win her to his will and wicked lust, The modest maid considring well the trust Of her great Dame; whom if she so offended, She iustly were of God and man condemned, Prayes and intreates his awfull maiestie Her not to force to such iniquitie, And breake the sacred Lawes (for lustfull rage) Of faithfull trust and holy marriage; So I poore wretch, whose fresh and youthfull chin Fine softest downe, to shadow did begin, Strangely amaz'd, and grieu'd at this foule fact, Abhorring eu'n the offer as the act: Yet with all due respect and reuerence, Did shew my duty and obedience: And thus replide: deare Mistresse, you shall find Me ready ay, to satisfie your mind, In all, where I may iustly you obay, And not my heauenly Masters will gainsay."
23035,"My master all commits vnto my hand, Nor knoweth he, how his owne state doth stand, No man is greater in his house then I, Nor doth he to my custody denie Ought but thy selfe; because thou art his wife, His onely comfort, deare delight, and life: How can I to this sinne then condescend, And not against my fathers God offend?"
23036,"The simple rude, saith she, a sinne it call, But here at Court, 'tis no offence at all; Those that are most seuere against this vice, Delight it most, Oh 'tis a deepe deuice Of Polititians, to make a law, To hold their children, wiues and fooles in aw, When they, then keepe it, nothing lesse intend, But at their pleasures diuersly offend: I know not one braue spirit in Pharohs Court, That this esteems of other then a sport, And yet their faire yong lusty able wiues Must, like reclused virgins, leade their liues; For my part I haue learned this by kind, Such measure as men meete vs, they shall find: Then blushing she doth Teares like Pearles distill, For she had teares and Blushes at her will."
23037,"But I replide, good Madame, be content, I cannot to your arguments consent: To proue from Greatnesse, lawfulnesse to euill, Is for to draw a Paterne from the Deuill, Who is the greatest worldly Potentate, Yet no excuse 'tis him to imitate: For great mens faults they are vnsearch'd, vnkowne To me; I haue enough to mend my owne: They that seuerely iudge sinne, yet delight Therein, they iudge themselues, and yet iudge right: And who do thus Gods iudgements iust abuse, Must neuer hope, that greatnesse shall excuse, Will you, because men wrong your sexe, offend, Your Maker?"
23038,"God such wickednesse defend, Embrace true chastitie of flesh and mind, Which honours men and graceth womankind."
23039,"But notwithstanding she, from day to day, Me wooes, yet would I not her voyce obay, But shun'd, by all good meanes, her company, Till one day she occasion did espy, I being in my closet all alone, And in the house not of the houshold one: Then all inrag'd with Fury heate and Lust, Like hungry Hawke that hath a Partridge trust, She on my garment ceasde immodestly And cride, come sleepe with me, or else I die."
23040,"Not Rachels losse, my Brethrens rage, nor yet The feare of Famine lying in the pit, Nor Midians bondage did me so perplexe, As now this womans furious Lust doth vexe, Who as the cruell Serpent's said to wind About the noble Elephant by kind; So winds this wicked monster, womans shame, About me to my sorrow and her blame What shall I fly?"
23041,"she me too fast doth hold, Shall I cry out?"
23042,"for shame be it not told A manlike heart did for a woman cry, Oh who can but bewayle my misery!"
23043,"Should I but now to dalliance consent, Me followes honour, pleasure, worlds content, But if that I this offerd grace reiect, Bondage, disgrace, a prison I expect, But fearing more diuine reuenging hand, Then racke, disgrace, imprisonment or band, Taking more pleasure in a conscience sound, Then all wealth, honours, ioyes she did propound, Acquite my body, though I left behind My garment, and out of the rome doe winde: So haue I seene some modest country maid, With some vnciuill vsage much dismaid, Closely her Aprons strings, to escape, vntie, And left it with the clowne, away to flie."
23044,"Who can the Leopards fell rage display, Chasing a Pilgrim fast vpon the way, And laying on his Cloke her cruell pawes, Eu'n ready to deuoure him in her Iawes, Who strucke with sudden terrour and affright, Forsakes his Cloake and scapes by winged flight, May tell the rage of this most cruell Dame, Who now hath nothing left, but spight and shame: Then raging, that her Beautie which she priz'd Aboue all others, should be so despis'd, Shee cals her Seruants in, and to them told, How that base Hebrew slaue was growne so bold, And proud of hers, and her deare husbands grace, That now he did aspire into his place; And would haue slept with her, had she not cride, All which his garment left here testifide, Which vp vntill her Lords returne, she laid, Then with my Coate her malice she displaid; For which my Lord, me into Prison cast, My daies in paine and miserie to waste; Thus lightly crediting the accusation, And his false Wifes most guilefull simulation, He by his rashnesse lost a seruant iust, And still maintaines a strumpets Pride and Lust."
23045,"But as a six-squar'd Dye, or carued stone, How euer cast, stands still vpright, all one, So was I constant in Aduersitie, As resolute in my prosperitie: That God which me had erst deliuered From Brethrens Fury, and me honored In time of my vniust captiuitie, Me leaues not now in this Calamitie, Oh happy they!"
23046,"whose Conscience them acquite, That heere they suffer wrong for doing right, So but a while Gods leisure they attend, They sure shall haue a good and happy end: Let Tyrants rage, they God as gentle, kind, In Prison, as in Paradise doe finde: Wherefore though I was of my Coate bereft, My masters Grace, and Fauour, and now left In stinking dungeon, yet I felt no harme, God gaue me power my Iailours hands to charme; And sent me in the Prison-Keepers sight, Fauour and grace for Potiphars despight."
23047,"For now that former diligence, which gain'd Mee fauour with my Lord, like trust obtain'd Mee in the Prison, so that to my care, Lo all the Prisoners committed are: The Keeper lookes to nought vnder his hand, God euer prospers all I did command."
23048,"About this season, as it oft befals, Great Fauorites in Court haue suddaine falls, By their owne faults, or others accusation, Or by their Lords dislike and alteration Of Fauorites: Two Lords of high regard In Pharohs Court, committed are to warde: The Keeper these doth to my trust commend, That I with diligence should them attend: These wanton Courtiers which had formerly Liu'd all in plentie, ease, and Iollitie, Acknowledging nor seruing other God Then Pharoh, and now chast'ned with his rod; As without soules this change of Fortune beare, But I by all meanes sought my charge to cheare, And told them, if indeed they guiltlesse were, The iustest King of Heau'n would finde them cleere; And if they had through frailtie him offended, So they their sinnes confessed and amended, Hee eu'n as willing was them to forgiue, As they in's Grace and fauour here to liue: How earthly Kings our bodies might enchaine, But still our soules in Freedome did remaine: With many such good words I sought to please My charge, who found therein no little ease, And grew lesse heauy; till both in one night Had seuerall Dreams, which did them much affright, Which soone as I had heard, I right aread, And as I told, so all things followed."
23049,"Such Visions are not like Dreames naturall, Which ordinary vs in sleepe befall: They in our Soules deeper impressions leaue, Then such as commonly the Sense deceiue; Which in the Fantasie worst reuell keepe, When Common-sense the Master is a sleepe; And doe th' Imagination vaine delight Sometime with hope, sometime with Feare affright, Working most on th' affections of the minde, When Sleepe the Bodies senses fastest binde, For eu'n in Sleepe,  The soules affections wake, and liuely moue."
23050,"God often by such Visions tels men plaine, What things they ought to doe, and what refraine, Sometimes by Dreames to them are promised Great Blessings, and great curses threatened: God oft thus shewes one his determination, And giues another the interpretation, Thus vnto me two Dreames by night he told, Which, as they proue, my Grand-sire did vnfold, Thus Pharohs Seruants first, and next their King See things to come, But the interpreting Was giu'n to me, which done, I told them plaine, Interpreting to God as Dreames pertaine: And now who thinkes, but that I thought it long Yet two yeares to abide in Prison strong?"
23051,"After I had so well interpreted His dreame, whom now the King so honored, But hauing learn'd with Patience to attend Gods leasure, and to hope vnto the end, Eu'n at that time, when as I least expected, So long of Pharohs Cup-bearer neglected, He that doth all things heere by weight and measure, On whom they all attend to doe his pleasure, By one poore Dreame but from an heathen King, What's long before decreed to passe doth bring: I rais'd to Grace, the World from Famine quite, The Butler doth acknowledge his ore-sight: South sayers weakenesse is discouered, And God is all in all acknowledged, My Brethren bold are to Repentance brought For all the wickednesse, which they had wrought: And this my wicked Mistris may reclame, And bring her to acknowledgement with shame, And make my master see his foolish passion, And learne to Iudge by better information: My two first Dreames proue true which I had told, My Fathers spirit reuiu'd now being old: Pharoh thus gaines the wealth of all his Land, And must acknowledge it from Gods owne hand, Thus all the parts of this sweet sacred story, Are for mans good, but end all with Gods glory, All these are now the Consequence and Theames Of mine, of Pharohs and his seruants Dreames."
23052,"See farther heere, Satans Maleuolence, And mans will freely serue Gods prouidence: Satan sought by my brethrens Crueltie, In me to ruine Isaacks Family."
23053,"My brethren me of wilfull enuie sould, And for the twentie siluer peeces told, The Midian Merchants bought me for their gaine, And into Egypt meant to sell againe: God hither sent me Graine heere to prouide, Else thou and all thy sonnes for want had dide: Thus Satan sought dishonour of Gods name, And all for this my Brethren rightly blame, Goodmen such Merchant's Couetise detest, That buy and sell Gods Image as a beast: But God who's only powrefull, good, and wise, From all these euils makes the Good arise."
23054,"But I thus hauing in great Pharohs grace, Obtain'd the first, in Realme the second place: First pray to God me to direct aright, To vse this fauour and my borrowed Light; Nor sought I mine owne honour, wealth, and praise, But his, who did me from the Dungeon raise, And therefore, first take care for publike good, Prouiding 'gainst the Future Famine food: Wherefore, I first through Egypt Circuit ride And garners great in eu'ry place prouide, In those seu'n fruitfull yeares to fill with store Of eu'ry Graine: And sith it is no more Vertue to purchase, then preserue, no tide I slipt, but did most carefully prouide, To kill all Vermine, cut off all excesse Of Gluttonie, and beastly Drunkennesse: Abate all needlesse Beasts, Dogges, Mules and Horse, Ridde idle Rogues and Vagrants, which are worse Then Catter-pillars to consume the store, To rob the richest and to sterue the poore: No Corne out of the Land let I goe out, But buy in rather from the Coasts about, And many Forrests which before did ly All waste, I vnto Tillage did apply: Thus I proceede, and God so blest my hand, That all things prosper ouer all the Land."
23055,"But when the yeares of plentie all are past, And all the Land of Egypt lyeth waste, So that they liue of former yeares remaines, Which them perhaps a month or two sustaines, The people first of Pharoh seeke supply, Who them to Ioseph sends; I suddenly Set ope the Barnes, and sell for money out The Corne to all the Nations round about."
23056,"Now is the time indeed, that I might buy Castles and Lands for my Posteritie, But I all money bring to Pharohs hand, To be the strength, and sinewes of the Land: If Pharoh will bestow on me a Place, Or money to buy Land, I of his Grace Will House and Land, as I my Office hold: Strangers in purchasing may be too bold."
23057,"When all their money's spent with buying bread, One yeare with Corne I them for Cattell fedde: But when the next yeare they in neede doe stand, I will for Corne their Bodies buy and Land, But all for Pharoh: whereby growing strong, He and his Empire may continue long: And to establish more his Segnurie, From Place to Place I will each Colonie Transplant, who on the East of Nile abide, I will remoue vnto the other side: Thus Pharoh Lord of Egypt shall be knowne, By Seisin, none shall say this is mine owne."
23058,"Thus haue I seene when Want or Waste compell A Gallant his Inheritance to sell, (Lest any right in him should still be thought) Giue place to him that hath the purchase bought, And in another Countrie dwelling hire, Whether he with his houshold may retire."
23059,"Thus will I doe with all the Common Lands, But for the Sacred in the Prophets hands, To Muses and to Learning dedicate, Or to Religious vses consecrate, I thinke it Sacriledge indeed to touch, Could all by this example learne as much: And let the Priests their Portions freely eate, Whose Braines in youth for vnderstanding sweate, Their age in Prayers and Perswasions spend, To saue the Good, and wicked to amend."
23060,"When I seau'n yeares haue furnisht them with bread, I in the eighth will furnish them with seede To sowe their Land, The fifth of whose increase Shall be the Kings: The other foure in Peace, They and their Housholds eate: And this shall stand For euer as a Law in Pharohs Land: The Priests Lands only shall be euer free, For to the Lord they consecrated bee."
23061,"Now, as I said, when I did Circuit ride, And Egypts Land suruai'd from side to side: One thing of greatest vse I did obserue, Which doth perpetuall memory deserue, Which, if it once were rightly vnderstood, Would force all studious of the publique good To doe, speake, write, of this most rare inuention, Till to effect they brought what next I mention: A peece of Land an Istmos, Barre, or stay, Twixt Midland-Sea, and the Arabian Bay, Suppos'd some  6."
23062,Herod plus distantiae po∣it.
23063,"2. ten Miles ouer at the most, Adioineth fast vnto th' Egyptian Coast, Which if one by a Channel did diuide, Both Seas might each into the other slide."
23064,"This if it were once  nauigable made, Would bring, to Kings and people of each trade, Such wondrous gaine as cannot be expected, With endlesse fame to those which it effected: For it would ope an easie way and prest To saile from Europe, Affricke, Asia-West Within few daies to the rich Indyes place, Which hardly now is done in three yeares space: How might all dwellers on the earth hereby, Soone be enriched by their Industrie?"
23065,"When by this Channel Merchants might conuey, Exchange of Merchandize so neare a way, Eu'n from the Northerne Iles and Westerne Lands To China, Ganges, and the Indian Sands."
23066,"This proiect I to Pharoh did commend, Intreating him this princely worke t' intend, But some base mindes, actiue in nought but ill, Men of acedious spirits, and little skill, Who are most forward ay to vilisie All workes of Honour, Art, and Industrie, Were ready this most noble worke to stay, Saying a Beare, or Lyon's in the way."

23075,"And whereas these fantastique men doe dreame, This to effect impossible doth seeme."
23076,"They without reason, selfe-conceited, wise, Against the publike profit this deuise; High  Mountaines, Rockes of flint haue bin made plaine, And forc'd to yeeld a passage to the Maine, Yea who knowes not that far more harder Quales sunt obelisci 4. quorum v. nusquis{que} erat 480. cu∣bitorum lon∣gitudine."
23077,"things, Haue beene effected by the Egyptian Kings, But neuer any of such Eminence, Nor any that could bring such recompence As this; For little labour, cost and paine, Would to th'whole world bring infinite great gaine."
23078,"Another let they tell as fond and vaine, That if this Barre be cut, th' Arabian Maine Doth rise so high, his waues would ouer-flow All th' Egyptian plaines, they ly so low: But I vpon my view could not descry Twixt Sea and Land such inequallitie: But howsoeueuer Earth, stones, and that doth rise From digging of the Channell, would suffice To raise Sea walles, for a most strong defence, Against the waters rage, and violence, And more secure on either side the shore, From ouerflowing then it was before, But though I haue small hope to win this Nation, To cut this shorter course, for Nauigation, Yet when that King to whose high Scepters sway, All Nations, will they, nill they, must obey, Shall rule as well o're Asia 'nd Europes Lands, As China, India, and Arabian Sands."
23079,"Some potent Monarch will himselfe alone, Or many Princes ioyning all in one, Will take this Noble enterprize in hand, And make this shorter passage to each Land, If not for th' ease and good of Nauigation, Yet for Gods Gloryes farther propagation, That so his Words and Wisedomes glorious sound, May through all Corners of the Earth resound, This for the publique good I haue made knowne, In Egypt, as I now to thee haue showne, Now whilst I for the Publique take such care, Pharoh at home a helpe doth me prepare, A Princes daughter, Egypts ornament, For whom King Pharoh with her Father sent, And welcomes thus: Great On!"
23080,"who by thy place, Art to me next, and second in my grace; Ioseph is first, whose merits to display, To light a candle were in clearest day: All Nilus Borders doe resound his fame, And honour most-deseruedly his name: Strength, youth, and vigour in his face appeares, And wisedome in his heart of graiest haires: His Beauty, as his Vertue hath no paire, Him would I match with Asenah thine heire, I know he is a stranger in this place, And wants Possessions, yet in Pharohs grace, And he thou know'st deserueth at my hands, To haue a part in all my Goods and Lands."
23081,"The reuerend Priest replyes: Dread Soueraigne, Lo!"
23082,"all the Place and honour I obtaine In Egypt, I acknowledge from thy grace: Which is enough to raise to highest place The meanest, But thou dost a match propound, Where Vertues more then honours doe abound: Amongst the many Fauours thou hast done Thy Seruant, this I deeme the highest one, A Priest to be so gracious in thy sight, To match his Childe with Pharohs Fauorite: May't please your Grace to aske the maids consent, But by her lookes, I see shee is content, For then her vaile (where modestly she shrouds Her radiant Rayes, as Sol doth his in clouds) Put off, such heau'nly Beautie did disclose, As if another Sunne in Court arose, Which as the Rising Sunne the Courtiers all Adore, and like a Queene before her fall: Then Pharoh saith, her taking by the hand, By silence thy consent we vnderstand, Good daughter, thou art like thy Parents faire, As of their Goods, be of their Graces heire: A fitter match for Ioseph none can find, If to thy Bodies grace thou suit thy minde, So, as thine outward Beauties heaun'ly shine, Thine inward shall b' Angellicall diuine, Oh!"
23083,"Labour to be glorious within, So Gods, mans Iosephs fauour thou shalt win, The King forth with then sends for me in haste, And first repeating all things as they past, With his owne hand her giues me for my Bride, Assuring vs for euer to abide As louing, as our Fathers naturall: When humbly I vpon my face did fall, And first gaue thankes, as dutie did require To Pharoh, next vnto her holy Sire."
23084,"As when Garden Adam all alone Saw Eue, flesh of his flesh, Bone of his Bone, He her embrac'd, kiss'd and so highly priz'd, As if all Beautie were epitomiz'd In his faire Rib, now with the Body met, (Two Sunnes, which but for sinne had neuer set) So I, who, though in honour, was alone In Egypt, till I met my flesh and Bone, Sweete Asenah, in whose faire eyes and face, I saw my mother Rachels comely grace; This Egypts Gem, whose eies I did behold, Like radiant Diamonds faire set in Gold; Embrace, kisse, loue her, and her Grace admire, And set her as the Bound of my desire: Thinking I now did reape with treble gaine, The Crop of all my trauell care and paine."
23085,"Then in the presence of the Court and King, I courted her with this speech following."
23086,"Faire Lady whose high Grace and Beautie seene To me your seruant, may become a Queene."
23087,"Yet art, (such is thine humblenesse) content To be poore Iosephs: without complement, I am all yours, nor doe I lesse esteeme Your worth, because you it so meanely deeme: Our Sexes duety to your Sexe I know, Is you to Court intreate and humbly woe, But since that seruice you to me remit, I will so much remaine more in your debt."
23088,"My time is pretious, therefore let me show To you in briefe, what Iosephs wife must doe."
23089,"It is not this worlds false, vaine glittering glory, So full of hazard, lubrique, transitorie, At which I aime: 'Tis an eternall place, Where we shall liue for ay in blessed case, Whether the gods, Th'Egyptians wont to serue, Can neuer bring you: He that will preserue This Land from Famine by th'interpretation Of Pharoh's Dreames, must bring to this saluation▪ One God with Ioseph must his wife adore, One God one true Religion, and no more: God iealous is, no Idol-stocke or stone, May be his Riuall, God, and Truth is one: These worldly shewes delights and vanitie, As Mortall with our Mortall Bodies die, The Pleasures which I speake off ay remaine, Eternall thus for Temporall we gaine."
23090,"This God my Fathers with their wiues haue serued Who to this day from dangers me preserued, This God me from the dungeon deepe did raise To be thy Husband, him for euer praise: Madame, your King and Father are content, But your owne mouth must shew your free consent."
23091,"When fairest Asenah long silence breakes, And as an Angell sent from Heau'n thus speakes: Good sir such is my due and filiall awe, My Fathers iudgement is to me a Law, Much more my Soueraignes: But such worth in you I see and heare of, I should rather sue, But for my Sexes bashfull modesty, For such an honour, rather then deny: Nor shall I meanely of my selfe thus deeme, To honour him, whom King and Realme esteeme Their Father, and the Kingdomes Fauourite."
23092,What greater Grace befals a mortall wight?
23093,"Sir, that Religion, which my holy Sire Taught me his child, inform'd my soules desire, Worlds Glory, Pompe, and vainenesse to despise, But thy Religion makes men heau'nly wise, And brings them by an vpright conuersation, To happy euer lasting habitation."
23094,"Therefore as thy Religion our transcends, As aiming at more high and happy ends, So greater is my Ioy and happinesse, To match, where I it truly must professe."
23095,"So sure as that (whereof thou didst diuine By Dreames) shall come to passe, so am I thine: Thy God shall be my God, and mine thy Nation, In earth, graue, heau'n one be our habitation: What thou approu'st as good, the same doe I; With thee, Sweete Hebrew, let me liue and dye."
23096,"Pardon: A womans Tongue knowes no content, Yea, is enough t'expresse a Maids consent."
23097,"Lo thus  in one, Two by Consent, become one Flesh and Bone."
23098,"Then princely On begins: Lo God hath tide These two in one, Let no Man them diuide: Deare Daughter, I to Ioseph thee commit, Thou therefore must thy Fathers house forget, And people: so shall sonnes before thee stand, Fit to beare rule as Princes in the Land: That God whom Pharoh, On and Ioseph serue, Who, as he all things made, doth all preserue, God who of things to come to Pharoh told By Dreames, which none but Ioseph could vnfold, When God him from the Dungeon did aduance, To saue vs by a great Deliuerance, God Authour sole, and end of happinesse, This holy Marriage and this Vnion blesse Of the Egyptian, and the Hebrew Nations; And make them happy in their Generations, And honour ay in heau'n our Sou'raigne King, As he his Seruants honours in this thing."
23099,"The King thus pleas'd in royall pompe and state With sumptuous Feasts and showes doth celebrate Our Marriage day, where all with Musique rings, And King and Court a happy Hymen sings."
23100,"Happy I hope though with an Heathen Dame, Whose Grace and Vertues I the rather name, That you may know we here as elsewhere finde, Some good as well as bad of woman-kind, As a loose wicked wife of Potiphar, So a most pious childe of Putiphar: But why should I time in her praises spend, Since her owne Workes, her best of all commend, God me hath giu'n, by her, two louely Boyes, Before the Famine, which are all my Ioyes: Lo!"
23101,"here shee kindly comes with all her traine, Her welcome Father for to entertaine: For now they all at Iosephs gate arriue, Where Pharohs Peares, and Seruants all doe striue, How best their Loues and Seruice shew they may, To adde more honour to this happy day."
23102,"When Asenah, first kneeling downe, begun Oh holy Father, of a blessed sonne, Blesse me thy Daughter; Blessed shall they be, Whom thou dost blesse: As welcome now to me, As dearest Ioseph to his Fathers sight."
23103,All Egypts glory yeelds not such delight.
23104,"When Iacob, Daughter; Fitter 'tis for me, To your great state, to bow my humble knee, But rightly you of me a blessing craue, No other Dower to bestow I haue, The Lord on thee from Heau'n all Blessings shower: But Iacobs tongue not hauing farther power, Now to expresse his Wondrous Ioy and Loue, His eyes produce abundant Teares to proue His ioyfull soule, for Iosephs happy state, When Iosephs Steward tells him it was late And supper time: Wherefore they all addrest Themselues, in their due order, to the feast."
23105,THE FIFTH BOOKE OF IOSEPH.
23106,"SOone as Aurora, with her blushing face, Vsherd the Gyant out to run his race, His longest Iourney from the East to West, Good Ioseph, though he ouernight did feast, Eu'n all th'astates of Egypt with their traine, His father in more state to entertaine, Gets vp and with his seruants all repaires Vnto a chappell by, to publike praiers, Which Pharoh had giu'n Ioseph there to serue God, who from famine Egypt did preserue, No time to men of action is so free For their deuotions, as the Mornings bee, Especially for those that liue at Court, Where they make Dinners long, but Prayers short, But they done; Ioseph doth his speech direct Thus to his Brethren: you perhaps expect, That I, now for mine owne and houses grace, Should raise you all to honourable place, And make you Lords at least in Pharohs land, But if you wisely things will vnderstand."
23107,"And know that honour ladeth more then graces, If wealth and vertues answer not your places, No grace nor honour can giue such contents To you, as quietly to liue in tents."
23108,"You that haue had your Breeding in such sort, Cannot obserue the Niceties of Court: They, whose ambition would be ouer all, The higher climb'd oft take the greater fall: Equals enuy▪ Superiours such disdaine, Inferiours maligne, all seeke their gaine, Grace and Preferment by anothers frowne; Who get vp seeke to thrust the other downe."
23109,"Courtiers are Dials, whilst Sol on them shines, Obseru'd of all, else but as painted Lines."
23110,"Many Court-honour onely do admire, And as another heau'n on earth desire: These onely looke on outward splendour, showne, Our inward cares and dangers are vnknowne, None would enuy our glory and content, Knew they the weight and cares of gouernment: They Altas burthen on their shoulders brare, To whom committed is the publique Care, Besides most stand in such high slippery places, I would not haue their hazard for their graces."
23111,"I speake not to dehort from gouernment The wise, for feare of griefes and discontent, Vnder this burthen they must bow their backe, Lest if the wicked rule all goes to wracke: But who are prudent, moderate and wise, Are rather raisd for worth, then seeke to rise: And such like tubs on their owne bottome stand, Nor neede the least support of others hand; When they which want this true worth of their owne, No sooner clamberd vp, but tumble downe, The first like fixed Starres stand firme and fast, Last make faire showes, like Comets, but sonne wast, Their matter is pure elementall fire, Of these ambitious humour and desire: Such is the Humour of Ambition vaine, For grace and offices to take much paine, Wherein they neuer comfort take nor rest, So feare of loosing doth their mind molest: When could they their faire Fortunes vse aright, They Freedome might enioy with much delight."
23112,"I fiue of you, my brethren, will present To Pharoh, who I know hath an intent To giue you any honour you require, But you his Fauour onely shall desire, And tell him plainely how you haue been bred, And heards and cattell all your life time fed."
23113,"(My reason is, for that this occupation Is here in Egypt of small reputation) Desiring you of his high grace may hold, Some pastures onely for your flocks and fold, Where you may serue God free from care and strife▪ And pray for Pharohs long and happy life: Should I you all now raise to Dignitie, Ones Folly ruine might the Family; Many vnited stronger are then one, But 'tis most: what more safe to stand alone: Especially so high; where one mans fall May make a breach, and so indanger all."
23114,"Oh happinesse, if knowne, of country bowers!"
23115,"Where in Deuotion they their freer howers May spend, and with Groues citizens sweet sing Diuinest praises to the heau'nly King: Where free from plots and vndermining Arts, All may the Truth speake boldly from their hearts, (For to a goodman 'tis no little paine To flatter for the greatest grace and gaine) There may they see their Lambs grow great and more, And heauenly blessings on their stocke and store; There may they see corne thriue vpon their lands, And God to prosper all workes passe their hands: Happy whose lot falls in so faire a ground, Such pleasures are at Court but seldome found; But lets make hast, my brethren to the court, My businesse is long, my time but short."
23116,"And now had Phoebus climb'd vp to such height, His beames did warme the world, as well as light, When Israell old; with trauell wearied, Slept sound, till waking, he much wondred (Thinking himselfe at first in his owne tents) To see such costly gorgeous ornaments: But soone remembring where he did abide, He turnes to Leah lying by his side: And thus begins, Deare wife!"
23117,"should I suruay Gods blessings from my birth, vnto this day, And in a summe his benefits recount; They would my dayes, nay eu'n my howres surmount."
23118,"His Goodnesse, Wisedome, Foure, Loue in those past Shin'd seuerall, but all now in this last: Goodnesse in drawing so much good from ill, To worke the sound good purpose of his will: His powre herein is manifestly showne, In raising vp the meeke, and throwing downe The prowd; his heauenly wisedome did foresee: And told vs all by dreames which now we see: The Starres eleu'n to Ioseph bow'd long sence, Now we the Sunne and Moone him reuerence: And lastly here appeares his wondrous Loue That all for's glory and our good doth proue."
23119,"Thus Israel doth Gods benefits recite, Beginning in the morning eu'n till night."
23120,"But whilst he thus Gods Bounty magnifide Like fairest Ewe with twin Lambs by each side, Comes Asenah, on either hand a sonne, Smugge, liuely, like two Rabbets newly run: Which seemd their mothers gracefull steps to guide, As two trim Squires that leade to Church a Bride, The tender boyes, whose mothers pious care, Before had taught themselues aright to beare, Downe on their knees before their Grandsire fall, And sweetly to him for his blessing call: The good old man whose heart doth dance for ioyes To see his Nephews, thus begins, sweete boyes, Which like two fairest Iuly flowers showne, Or buds of damaske Roses scarcely blowne."
23121,Oh these my daughter giue you more content Then Egypts wealth and costliest ornament.
23122,"Me thinks they hang vpon each arme of thine, Like two faire Clusters on a fruitfull Vine."
23123,"These shall renew our dying memory, And vs reuiue vnto Posteritie."
23124,"Behold I see in little Ephraims face, My dearest Rachels louely lookes and grace."
23125,"Manasses like to Ioseph doth appeare, Who aboue all his brethen was my deare."
23126,"my daughter, how much am I bound To you, for vndeserued fauours found; But Ioseph more; a Princesse of your state So lowly to descend to be his mate?"
23127,"God make him worthy of your grace and loue, And that he may as acceptable proue To you his deare, as he was wont be blest With highest fauours, alwayes of the best."
23128,"For he at home in Bondage, Prison, Court, In grace was alwayes with the better sort."
23129,"I Potiphar the Gaoler, and the King Best lou'd and trusted him in euery thing: Then Asenah?"
23130,"I wish you were obserued Here, my deare father, as you haue deserued: As for your sonne no noblenesse of birth, Nor Egypts dowers can counteruaile his worth, Who me hath taught the vanity of state, Me worthy make as happy of my mate; Such is his worth and noblenesse of mind, I wonder not that he should fauour find Amongst the best: But shall I you intreate To tell your daughter, what you vse to eate, For here you all must as at home command, We but desire your will to vnderstand."
23131,"Daughter saith Iacob I was neuer nice Nor dainty to consume things of high price, That's alwayes best you easiliest can prepare, Better are homely Cates then forraine fare."
23132,"My heards my foode, my sheepe my clothing breade, No better weare I, nor no other feede: Sixe score and ten yeares haue I beene content To liue on milke, fruits, and such nourishment: Yet few or none that to mine age attaine, So strong of body are, and free from paine: But aboue all, the weather being faire, I loue to walke abroad in freshest aire; After my mornings draught to stirre, is good For to refresh the Spirits and warme the blood, This is the way diseases to preuent, I thanke God, I neere knew what phisicke ment."
23133,"Thus whilst they talke in plaine familiar sort, Lo Ioseph vnexpected comes from Court, And tells his father, how he did present His brethren to the King, who is content Them to employ according to their breeding, In looking vnto sheepe and cattell feeding, And now he much desires to see your face, And with all Courtly honour you to grace: I (Iacob saith) with all my heart will goe To that good King, that Ioseph honours so, But I desire of him no greater grace, Then to liue in his Land and see thy Face, I hope he likewise will conceiue my breeding, And leaue me to my flockes and Cattell feeding."
23134,"Ioseph his Father then to Pharoh brings, Who doing first Obeisance due to Kings Begins, oh!"
23135,"blessed, blest thou euer be, That rais'd my Ioseph to such Dignitie, From Dungeon where stockes did his Limbs enroule, And yrons enter'd eu'n into his Soule, To rule all Egypt by thy borrowed might, And be alone great Pharohs Fauorite."
23136,"And blest be ay for thy Benignitie, Who sauest me and all my Family From perishing; Alas!"
23137,"for want of food, God render in thy Bosome all thy good, And double thy fore-Fathers daies vpon Thee, and thy seede that sit vpon thy throne."
23138,"Thus ends the Sage: when Pharoh thus replide, How much more cause haue I to blesse the tide, That noble Ioseph did to Egypt driue, To saue me and my people all aliue: Come hither Iacob, let me thee embrace, How can I but loue thee, and all thy race, Whom now as Cause and Author I doe see Oh Ioseph?"
23139,"Father of all mine and mee: It ioyes me Israel most exceedingly, When I thy sonne in ought can gratifie, To whom my Kingdome, Life, and all I ow, As thou and thine, and all the people know: God sent thy Ioseph, as a man before, To lay vp here against this famine store, For had we not by his foresight beene fed, We, thou and all, for want, had perished."
23140,"Thy Ioseph doth informe my Senatours, And Wisedome teach vnto my Counsellours: Well may he rule then ore my house and Land, And all my substance haue at his command, I am to this by Prouidence but led, God hath indeed thus Ioseph honored."
23141,"Thou seemst of no lesse wisedome and defert, Then good old father, tell how ould thou art, And in what course, thou hast worne out this terme, I aske not to examine, but to learne: Examples more then precepts teach to liue; Good King, saith Iacob, thou doest eu'n reuiue My older age to heare thy wondrous loue To Ioseph, whom more then my selfe I loue."
23142,"But seeing thou inquirest of mine age, Know that the dayes here of my Pilgrimage A hundred and full thirty yeares haue beene, The dayes are few and ill which I haue seene, Nor haue I yet attained to the age, And dayes of my forefathers Pilgrimage."
23143,"Two things I studdy here especially, The first to liue well, second well to die, For what is all our life once gone and past, But eu'n a way vnto our happy last."
23144,The terme from whence to all flesh is the wombe; That whither all doe hasten is the Tombe.
23145,"He happiest here who findeth on the way, Fewest impediments his course to stay."
23146,"Some passe through sicknesse, pouerty, some wealth, Honour, preferment, pleasure, strength and health, Some equally of both participate, This is the meane, yet safe and happiest Fate, The highest I did euer here aspire: And in this state I still to liue desire."
23147,"The highest honours to your Grace are due, For God hath with a Kingdome honourd you, Whereof you haue your selfe most worthy showne, In looking to Gods glory, not your owne."
23148,"Wisely therefore, I speake it to your praise, You honour them, whom God would haue you raise, And in your Kingdome prudently depresse, Those whom God hateth for their wickednesse."
23149,"Thus needs your Gouernment must happy be, When King and Senatours in one agree, The proud to cast downe, and to raise the iust, So may the Rulers one another trust."
23150,"God that from Famine vs deliuered, And by a dreame foretold, thee counselled Both for thy land, and houshould to prouide, And all the world, which else for want had dide, Feede thee with inward and spirituall grace, And giue in heau'n an euerlasting place, For this, I your poore Beadsman, night and day, Will in a homely countrey cottage pray."
23151,"Pharoh much ioy'd, would faine haue entertaind, And him at his owne boord with bread sustaind▪ But good old Iacob modestly denide, And sayd, How long haue I on earth to bide?"
23152,"I cannot now of good from ill make choyce, Nor musique iudge by instrument or voyce, Why should I be a burthen to the King?"
23153,"And he reward so my small-meriting, But let my sonne for me before thee stand, And ready alwayes be at thy command."
23154,"Good man, saith Pharaoh, I haue giu'n command To place thee in the fattest of my Land, The Land of Goshen be a habitation To thee, thy children and thy generation There is best pasture-ground for them to keepe, Their Camels, Asses, Cattell, Gotes and Sheepe."
23155,"To raise to place of honour I desire Thee and thy sonnes, but they of me require Still to be Heardsmen: wherefore the most bould And actiue, I make Rulers of my fould."
23156,Then Iacob blessing Pharoh did depart Out of his presence with a ioyfull heart.
23157,"Seu'nteene yeares after in prosperitie, Liu'd Iacob and did greatly multiplie, And Ioseph in his former Grace did stand, Still vnder Pharoh ruling all the Land."
23158,"Nor might be ere out of his masters sight, Because he was his onely Fauorite, Till one day Ioseph, absent from the Court, Pharoh bespeakes his seruants in this sort."
23159,"Nere thrise ten times the Sunne with panting horse Hath run through heau'n his swift and yeerly course, Since first arose in this our hotter clime, That hebrew Sun, which euer since did shine, And all the time he did in court appeare, We haue had Spring and Summer all the yeare, I cannot eate by day nor sleepe by night, Without his Beames most comfortable bright: That honest man, in whose ingenuous face, A man may reade what in his heart hath place, Now, by my life, I higher doe esteeme This Hebrew, then great Egypts Diademe."
23160,"Nor is it to the least of you vnknowne, He hath beene better to me then my Crowne, And beares still for me, to all mens content, The weight of all my kingdomes gouernment, In those seu'n yeares of Famine and of Store, When his employments greater were and more, If he were but one day out of my sight, I certaine was to heare from him at night, But now of's light hath beene neere three daies pause Yet no man here will tell to me the cause."
23161,When thus the Butler (who by Pharohs grace Restor'd was as he dream'd to's former place) Dread Soueraigne!
23162,"some small clouds do in this sort Shadow his beames, which wont to shine at Court: But no defect in his ay-constant light, He's still the same, and shines as euer bright."
23163,"Ioseph at home for Pharohs health now prayes, To Israels God, these are his mourning dayes."
23164,"His father old now sleepes in happy rest, Who dying made to him this last request."
23165,"My dearest sonne the honour of my race, If in thy sight thy father hath found grace, (For though thou art my sonne by true relation Yea I am subiect to thy domination) Now graciously and truely with me deale, Not for my priuate, but our common weale; Well do I know that our posteritie, Will soone admire faire showes and vanitie, And not regard the land of happinesse, The Type of future and of present blesse, Therefore to me, my dearest Ioseph, sweare, Thou wilt not me in Egypt here enterre, But safely carry to the land of Rest."
23166,"With my forefathers there my Bones to rest, It may be ours will sooner hasten thither, Where all their Fathers Bones doe lye togither."
23167,"Then Ioseph sware and Israel worshipped, The Feare of Isaack sitting on his bed."
23168,"These words he me desir'd, with many teares, That I would publish in King Pharohs eares, And Licence of thee to that end obtaine, Which done he would to Court returne againe."
23169,"When Pharoh thus: Is that good old man dead, Like apple ripe in Autumne gathered?"
23170,"We all must follow, who can tell how soone, Some fall at night, at morning, some at noone?"
23171,"But I desire, if any here can tell, How that good old man dide, that liu'd so well, For most what it befals mortalitie, As they haue liued here, eu'n so to dye."
23172,"Good Ioseph, saith the Butler, thus me told, That Iacob growing weake, as he grew old, He Ephraim and Manasses his two sonnes, Takes with him, and vnto his Father comes, Wherewith his weakenesse greatly comforted, He takes his strength, and sits vp in his bed."
23173,"And thus begins: My sonne, my Ioseph deare, The God Almightie did to me appeare At Luz in Canaan, where he did me blesse, And promise to my seede much fruitfulnesse, Assuring me to make a mightie Nation, And giue that Land vnto my Generation: For those two sonnes God here hath giu'n to thee, Before my comming, thou shalt giue them me, As Simeon and Ruben, they are mine, Thy Children since begotten, shall be thine; These two, I meane, shall be two Tribes, The rest In these Tribes names, shall be of Land possest▪ For I a double portion thee allot, As my First borne: Because I thee begot Of Rachel deare, my first, my lawfull Wife, Who on my hand in Canaan left her life, Her there, alas!"
23174,"I buried on the way To Ephrata, call'd Beth'lem to this day."
23175,But what are these two Lads?
23176,"my Ioseph deare, My sonnes saith Ioseph God first gaue me heere: Oh!"
23177,"bring them me saith Iacob to this place, Before I die, to kisse, blesse, and embrace: Sweet Boyes!"
23178,"Good Ioseph, I nere thought indeed To see thy face, but now I see thy seede: The old man then, though he were dimme of sight, His left hand on Manasses, and his right On younger Ephraim layes, and wittingly, Thus blesseth Ioseph in his Progeny: God in whose sight I here haue walk'd alway, Who all my Life-long fed me to this day, The God of Abram, and great Isaacks dread, And th' Angell which hath me deliuered From euill, blesse these Lads, and let my name With name of Isaack and of Abraham, Be in them nam'd and in their Tribes renew'd; And grow on earth eu'n to a multitude."
23179,"But it displeasing was to Iosephs sight, To see on Ephraims head, him lay his right, And on Manasses his left hand to place; And would his First borne with the right hand grace, But Iacob nould, but said I know indeed Thy First-borne shall be great: But lo!"
23180,"the seede Of Ephraim, shall be greater farre then he, And a more strong and mightie people be."
23181,"Thus aged Iacob bless'd them both that day, And said in thee let Israel blesse and say, God send thee Ephraims and Manasses store, But Ephraim he Manasses set before: Then said he, Lo!"
23182,"I die, now out of hand, And God shall bring you to your fathers land, Then ere he dide, he swan-like sung this song, Most sweete, because he liu'd not after long."
23183,Iacobs last blessing.
23184,"Sith, my deare sonnes, I haue not long to dwell On earth, come hither: and I will you tell, What shall come on you in the latter dayes, Assemble and attend your Fathers Sayes: RubenMy first borne Ruben, thou that art the might, And first beginning of my strength by right, Thou shouldst haue all my Power and Dignitie, Which thou hast lost by thine iniquitie: Vnstable water!"
23185,"thou shalt not be head, Because thou wentst vp to thy fathers bed, For then indeed thou didst my couch defile, And thy true right of first-borne lost the while: Simeon &Simeon and Leui, Brethren, instruments Leui.Of cruelty, neare to your fathers tents, My soule come not neare to their congregations, Mine honour ioyne not in their machinations, Who in their Wrath the Sichemites slew all, And in their Fury digged downe a wall: Curst be their wrath, for it was voyd of shame, And Fiercenesse which was cruelly to blame, Lo!"
23186,"I their seede in Iacob will diuide, And them abroad in Israel scatter wide."
23187,"IudahIudah is next, whom all his brethren praise, Thine hand be in thine enemies necke alwayes, Thy Fathers Children thee shall stoupe before, Lo Iudah like a Lyons whelpe shall rore, My sonne comes like a Lion from the spoile, Who laid him downe, and couch'd himselfe awhile, Eu'n like a Lion or a Lionesse, Who dares awake him from his sleepinesse?"
23188,"The Scepter from his race shall neuer start, Nor a Law giuer from his feete depart, Till the Messias come, who to him shall By his great powre the Nations gather all; Lo!"
23189,"he shall binde his Foale vnto the Vine, His Colt vnto the Branch, His Cloke in Wine Is washt; His Cloths with bloud of grapes bedight, Eyes red with wine: His Teeth with milke are white."
23190,"The Sea-Haun's Zabulon shall dwell beside,Zabulon."
23191,"And's Border eu'n to Sidon shall diuide, Like a strong Asse shall Isachar couch low Betweene two burthens,Isachar."

23193,"Dan shall be Iudge and one of Israels Tribes,Dan."
23194,"A serpent by the way him well describes, Or Adder in the path, horse-heeles to gall, Vntill he make the rider backward fall: To be a Iudge's a dangerous Vocation, Lord I haue waited long for thy Saluation."
23195,"An host of men God downe in warre shall cast,Gal."

23200,"But fauour seekes with pleasing words to finde: Ioseph's like plant by well, whose boughs are small,Ioseph."
23201,"Yet run vp flourishing vpon the wall: With shooting many Archers haue him harm'd And with sharpe Darts to's hindrance him disarm'd; But he stands fast, his armes are made so strong By God, to whom all strength and powre belong, His glory all his Brethrens doth excell, And hee's become a stone in Israel: His Fathers God shall helpe him from aboue, And the Almightie with his Blessings proue: With Blessings that from hight and depth shall come, With Blessings of the Breasts and of the Wombe, To thee thy Fathers Blessings be more strong, Then those that doe from mine, to me belong: From th'vtmost hils they light on Iosephs head, That from his Brethren once was seuered."
23202,"Beniamin.Beniamin like a Wolfe shall spoile: The prey He shall diuide by night, and eate by day: Thus Iacob of each seuerall prophecide, What should to their Posteritie betide: Some call it his last will: Then to them all, He dying spake these words in generall."
23203,"We all are Pilgrims on the way, our home Is Heau'n; as all men enter by the Wombe, So through the Gate of Death, we all must driue, Before we at this Citie faire arriue: Lusts of our youth, Infirmities of age, Make few and ill our daies of Pilgrimage, All spend like Lamps, some blowne out with a blast, Some waste, some melt, some hold out till the last: Like fruit all blow, bud, grow greene, ripe, then fall; Bud, blossome, greene, or ripe, we perish all: And turn'd to dust, are vnder Deaths subiection In Graue, vntill the day of Resurrection."
23204,"Eu'n as our ages, so we change our minde, For those things we doe most delightfull finde To Child-hood, Youth disdaines; our Youth-full fires Accord not with our riper yeares desires: Old-age in none of all the three delights, The reason's plaine, we serue our appetites: Truth and Religions path we leaue to treade, And follow as our Lusts and Pleasures leade; Which alter with our bodies constitutions, And these are sensuall, beastly resolutions: But who doth his affections measure by Right rules of Reason, and of Pietie, Them neuer alters, but is still the same, All tending to the glory of Gods name: No change of  Can alter such desires and resolution."
23205,"This Life's a minute to Eternitie, Like mite vnto the Globes immensitie, Like droppe compard vnto the Ocean Maine, Yet here we either all must lose or gaine; Vpon this mite, droppe, minute doth depend, All Blisse, we aye continue as we end."
23206,"All Gods most gracious, glorious promises, But types and Shadowes are of future Blesse; Phari on Land, vs to the Port to light; And guide our Barkes through worlds darke misty night, In all our voiage, through worlds Ocean-wast, Are many Rockes and dangers to be past; Without are Satan and the Worlds infections, Within, our Lusts, vaine, fraile, and vile affections, Which like so many Traitours readiely Against the Pilot ay to mutiny; But most in danger of them all we stand, When nearest we approch vnto the Land: So some escape the boistrous raging Sea, And neere the Port doe wrecke vpon the Lea: I looking backe my span like daies behold, Like a fantastique Dreame or tale new told, And were I now them to begin againe, I should all worldly vaine delights refraine, Yea could you see heau'ns Ioyes by Faiths cleare eyes, You would with me Worlds Pleasures vaine despise, And runne fast to the marke you set before Your end; to liue with God for euermore."
23207,"As th'aire is hottest neerest to the Sunne, Brookes deeper, neerer to the Sea they runne, So nearer to your end; doe you aspire To grow in grace, and glow with heaun'ly fire; Now goe I hence, and shall be seene no more, Haue mine examples alwaies you before, So Isaack followed faithfull Abraham, I holy Isaack, from whose loines I came, What we did well doe you the like: But when We did amisse, obserue we were but men."

23211,"Oh make it knowne to all your Generations, God vs hath chose before all other Nations, To walke here worthy of this Grace diuine, And like to purest heau'nly Tapers shine, In this worlds mistie darke obscured night, Whose euill workes abhorre to see the light."
23212,"Expect not worlds vaine glory, Pompe and state, Those that liue Godly here, the world will hate, But God doth euer them most highly prize, Who here are meanest in the wickeds eyes."
23213,"The World will you deride, and say that this, But some vaine, peeuish, single humor is, Or some light idle motion, which doth rise From some meane, ignorant, conceited wise, Despise their censures, for I certaine know The spirit, whence such heau'nly motions flow: What care I how their worldly wisdome deeme, Of them, So they with God be in esteeme?"
23214,"were my words now written in a booke, That who, so list to learne, on them might looke, Or with a Diamonds point engrauen plaine, On Adamant, for euer to remaine."
23215,"I know that my Redeemer true and iust Liues, and shall raise vs at the last from dust, And though the wormes my skin and flesh destroy, I God shall in my body see with ioy, Eu'n with mine owne; and with no other eyes: But now my spirit begins so high to rise, As if she meant to leaue this habitation, And flye to heau'n, by holy contemplation; Oft hath she striu'd to rise before this day, As weary of her brittle Tent of Clay, But hath beene by the weight thereof deprest, But now shee feeles her selfe from thence releast, I cannot last, my Lampe so fast doth spend, And now burnes clearest, nearest to the end, Farewell deare sonnes; my Blessing on you all Continue to your after-Ages shall."
23216,"Oh God of Life; now thou dost me denie, The Powre to liue, me willing make to die."
23217,"These all are those twelue Tribes of Israel, Which good old Iacob blest and wished well, Besides the blessing to each seuerall, Wherein he told them what should after fall: And now as Ioseph erst he made to sweare, So chargeth he eu'n all his Children there, To lay him in that place of Buriall, Where his fore-fathers were interred all: Thus when his swan-like song was at an end, And all commanded that he did intend, He plucked vp his feete into the Bed, And was vnto his people gathered."
23218,"saith Pharoh, God me send Eu'n such a life, and such a happy end."
23219,"Lo, farther Pharoh did that day command, That all his Peeres and Nobles of the Land, Should goe with Ioseph and his Brethren all, To honour holy Iacobs funerall: Where they seu'n dayes made so great Lamentation, They draue the Cananites to admiration: And after he was buried in this sort, Ioseph returnes againe to Pharohs Court, His Brethren vnto Goshen, where in peace, They Liued, and did mightily increase, Till Ioseph was an hundred ten yeares old, So that he Ephraims children did behold, To their third Generation, and the seede Of Machir, eldest of Manasses Breed, Sate on his knees: Then saith he, lo I die, But God will visit you assuredly, And in that Land, a place for you prepare, As he to Abram, Isaack, Iacob sware, Then, as I sware to Iacob, to me sweare, Thither my Bones with you from hence to beare, His Brethren sware: So Ioseph, as I told, Dide honourably being very old, Whose Body they imbalmed in a Chest, And after carryed to the land of Rest: Where they erect a Pillar on his graue, And thereupon this Epitaph engraue: FINIS."

23221,"HIs Fathers Darling, mothers deare delight."
23222,"Obiect of Satans malice, Brethrens spite: To Master iust; chaste, faithful to his Dame: In Prison free, cōdemn'd, yet void of blame: From Dungeon raisd to highest reputation, By Wisdome, Counsell, Dreames, and Diuinatiō: Thus God by him a great deliuerance wrought, In sauing them, who his destruction sought: A diligent, wise, prouident Obseruer, And therefore of Mankinde a great preseruer."
23223,"In Padan borne, In Canaan nourished, In Midian bound, in Aegypt honoured, From whence his soule flew to eternall Rest, His Bones here in like expectation rest."
