"165",165,"Genesis",1,7,5,"Noah therefore did according vnto all that the Lord commanded him."
"166",166,"Genesis",1,7,6,"And Noah was sixe hundreth yeeres olde, when the flood of waters was vpon the earth."
"167",167,"Genesis",1,7,7,"So Noah entred and his sonnes, and his wife, & his sonnes wiues with him into the Arke, because of the waters of the flood."
"168",168,"Genesis",1,7,8,"Of the cleane beastes, and of the vncleane beastes, and of the foules, and of all that creepeth vpon the earth,"
"169",169,"Genesis",1,7,9,"There came two and two vnto Noah into the Arke, male and female, as God had commanded Noah."
"170",170,"Genesis",1,7,10,"And so after seuen dayes the waters of the flood were vpon the earth."
"171",171,"Genesis",1,7,11,"In the sixe hundreth yeere of Noahs life in the second moneth, the seuetenth day of the moneth, in the same day were all the fountaines of the great deepe broken vp, and the windowes of heauen were opened,"
"172",172,"Genesis",1,7,12,"And the raine was vpon the earth fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes."
"173",173,"Genesis",1,7,13,"In the selfe same day entred Noah with Shem, and Ham and Iapheth, the sonnes of Noah, and Noahs wife, and the three wiues of his sonnes with them into the Arke."
"174",174,"Genesis",1,7,14,"They and euery beast after his kinde, and all cattell after their kinde, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth after his kinde, and euery foule after his kinde, euen euery bird of euery fether."
"175",175,"Genesis",1,7,15,"For they came to Noah into ye Arke, two and two, of all flesh wherein is ye breath of life."
"176",176,"Genesis",1,7,16,"And they entring in, came male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in."
"177",177,"Genesis",1,7,17,"Then ye flood was fourtie dayes vpon the earth, and the waters were increased, and bare vp the Arke, which was lift vp aboue the earth."
"178",178,"Genesis",1,7,18,"The waters also waxed strong, and were increased exceedingly vpon the earth, and the Arke went vpon the waters."
"179",179,"Genesis",1,7,19,"The waters preuailed so exceedingly vpon the earth, that all the high mountaines, that are vnder the whole heauen, were couered."
"180",180,"Genesis",1,7,20,"Fifteene cubites vpwarde did the waters preuaile, when the mountaines were couered."
"181",181,"Genesis",1,7,21,"Then all flesh perished that moued vpon the earth, both foule and cattell and beast, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth, and euery man."
"182",182,"Genesis",1,7,22,"Euery thing in whose nostrels the spirit of life did breathe, whatsoeuer they were in the drie land, they died."
"183",183,"Genesis",1,7,23,"So he destroyed euery thing that was vpon the earth, from man to beast, to ye creeping thing, and to the foule of the heauen: they were euen destroyed from the earth; Noah onely remained; & they that were with him in ye Arke."
"184",184,"Genesis",1,7,24,"And the waters preuailed vpon the earth an hundreth and fiftie dayes."
"185",185,"Genesis",1,8,1,"Nowe God remembred Noah and euery beast, and all the cattell that was with him in the Arke: therefore God made a winde to passe vpon the earth, and the waters ceased."
"186",186,"Genesis",1,8,2,"The fountaines also of the deepe and the windowes of heauen were stopped and the raine from heauen was restrained,"
"187",187,"Genesis",1,8,3,"And the waters returned from aboue the earth, going and returning: and after the ende of the hundreth and fiftieth day the waters abated."
"188",188,"Genesis",1,8,4,"And in the seuenth moneth, in the seuenteenth day of the moneth, the Arke rested vpon the mountaines of Ararat."
"189",189,"Genesis",1,8,5,"And the waters were going and decreasing vntill the tenth moneth: in the tenth moneth, and in the first day of the moneth were the toppes of the mountaines seene."
"190",190,"Genesis",1,8,6,"So after fourtie dayes, Noah opened the windowe of the Arke, which he had made,"
"191",191,"Genesis",1,8,7,"And sent forth a rauen, which went out going forth and returning, vntill the waters were dried vp vpon the earth."
"192",192,"Genesis",1,8,8,"Againe he sent a doue from him, that he might see if the waters were diminished from off the earth."
"193",193,"Genesis",1,8,9,"But the doue found no rest for the sole of her foote: therefore she returned vnto him into the Arke (for the waters were vpon the whole earth) and he put forth his hand, and receiued her, and tooke her to him into the Arke."
"194",194,"Genesis",1,8,10,"And he abode yet other seuen dayes, and againe he sent forth the doue out of the Arke."
"195",195,"Genesis",1,8,11,"And the doue came to him in ye euening, and loe, in her mouth was an oliue leafe that she had pluckt: whereby Noah knewe that the waters were abated from off the earth."
"196",196,"Genesis",1,8,12,"Notwithstanding he wayted yet other seuen dayes, and sent forth the doue, which returned not againe vnto him any more."
"197",197,"Genesis",1,8,13,"And in the sixe hundreth and one yeere, in the first day of the first moneth the waters were dryed vp from off the earth: and Noah remoued the couering of the Arke and looked, and beholde, the vpper part of the ground was drie."
"198",198,"Genesis",1,8,14,"And in the second moneth, in the seuen & twentieth day of the moneth was the earth drie."
"199",199,"Genesis",1,8,15,"Then God spake to Noah, saying,"
"200",200,"Genesis",1,8,16,"Goe forth of the Arke, thou & thy wife, and thy sonnes and thy sonnes wiues with thee."
"201",201,"Genesis",1,8,17,"Bring forth with thee euery beast that is with thee, of all flesh, both foule and cattell, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth, that they may breede abundantly in ye earth, and bring forth fruite & increase vpon ye earth."
"202",202,"Genesis",1,8,18,"So Noah came forth, and his sonnes, and his wife, and his sonnes wiues with him."
"203",203,"Genesis",1,8,19,"Euery beast, euery creeping thing, and euery foule, all that moueth vpon the earth after their kindes went out of the Arke."
"204",204,"Genesis",1,8,20,"Then Noah built an altar to the Lord & tooke of euery cleane beast, & of euery cleane foule, and offered burnt offerings vpon the altar."
"205",205,"Genesis",1,8,21,"And the Lord smelled a sauour of rest, and the Lord said in his heart, I will hencefoorth curse the ground no more for mans cause: for the imagination of mans heart is euill, euen from his youth: neither will I smite any more all things liuing, as I haue done."
"206",206,"Genesis",1,8,22,"Hereafter seede time & haruest, & colde and heate, and sommer and winter, and day and night shal not cease, so long as ye earth remaineth."
"207",207,"Genesis",1,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sonnes, and said to them, Bring foorth fruite, and multiplie, and replenish the earth."
"208",208,"Genesis",1,9,2,"Also the feare of you, and the dread of you shalbe vpon euery beast of the earth, and vpon euery foule of the heauen, vpon all that moueth on the earth, and vpon all the fishes of the sea: into your hand are they deliuered."
"209",209,"Genesis",1,9,3,"Euery thing that moueth and liueth, shall be meate for you: as the greene herbe, haue I giuen you all things."
"210",210,"Genesis",1,9,4,"But flesh with the life thereof, I meane, with the blood thereof, shall ye not eate."
"211",211,"Genesis",1,9,5,"For surely I will require your blood, wherein your liues are: at the hand of euery beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, euen at the hand of a mans brother will I require the life of man."
"212",212,"Genesis",1,9,6,"Who so sheadeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God hath he made man."
"213",213,"Genesis",1,9,7,"But bring ye forth fruite & multiplie: grow plentifully in the earth, and increase therein."
"214",214,"Genesis",1,9,8,"God spake also to Noah & to his sonnes with him, saying,"
"215",215,"Genesis",1,9,9,"Behold, I, euen I establish my couenant with you, and with your seede after you,"

"217",217,"Genesis",1,9,11,"And my couenant will I establish with you, that from henceforth all flesh shall not be rooted out by ye waters of the flood, neither shall there be a flood to destroy the earth any more."
"218",218,"Genesis",1,9,12,"Then God saide, This is the token of the couenant which I make betweene me and you, and betweene euery liuing thing, that is with you vnto perpetuall generations."
"219",219,"Genesis",1,9,13,"I haue set my bowe in the cloude, and it shalbe for a signe of the couenant betweene me and the earth."
"220",220,"Genesis",1,9,14,"And when I shall couer the earth with a cloud, and the bowe shall be seene in the cloude,"
"221",221,"Genesis",1,9,15,"Then will I remember my couenant, which is betweene me and you, and betweene euery liuing thing in all flesh, and there shalbe no more waters of a flood to destroy all flesh."
"222",222,"Genesis",1,9,16,"Therefore the bowe shalbe in the cloude, that I may see it, and remember the euerlasting couenant betweene God, and euery liuing thing in all flesh that is vpon the earth."
"223",223,"Genesis",1,9,17,"God said yet to Noah, This is the signe of the couenant, which I haue established betweene me and all flesh that is vpon the earth."
"224",224,"Genesis",1,9,18,"Nowe the sonnes of Noah going foorth of the Arke, were Shem and Ham and Iapheth; Ham is the father of Canaan."
"225",225,"Genesis",1,9,19,"These are the three sonnes of Noah, and of them was the whole earth ouerspred."
"226",226,"Genesis",1,9,20,"Noah also began to be an husband man and planted a vineyard."
"227",227,"Genesis",1,9,21,"And he drunke of ye wine and was drunken, & was vncouered in the middes of his tent."
"228",228,"Genesis",1,9,22,"And when Ham the father of Canaan sawe the nakednesse of his father, he tolde his two brethren without."
"229",229,"Genesis",1,9,23,"Then tooke Shem & Iapheth a garment, and put it vpon both their shoulders, and went backwarde, and couered the nakednesse of their father with their faces backwarde: so they sawe not their fathers nakednesse."
"230",230,"Genesis",1,9,24,"Then Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his yonger sonne had done vnto him,"
"231",231,"Genesis",1,9,25,"And said, Cursed be Canaan: a seruant of seruants shall he be vnto his brethren."
"232",232,"Genesis",1,9,26,"He said moreouer, blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and let Canaan be his seruant."
"233",233,"Genesis",1,9,27,"God perswade Iapheth, that he may dwell in the tentes of Shem, and let Canaan be his seruant."
"234",234,"Genesis",1,9,28,"And Noah liued after the flood three hundreth and fiftie yeeres."

"321",321,"Genesis",1,13,2,"And Abram was very rich in cattell, in siluer and in golde."
"322",322,"Genesis",1,13,3,"And he went on his iourney from ye South toward Beth-el, to the place where his tent had bene at ye beginning, betweene Beth-el & Haai,"
"323",323,"Genesis",1,13,4,"Vnto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the Name of the Lord."
"324",324,"Genesis",1,13,5,"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had sheepe, and cattell and tentes,"
"325",325,"Genesis",1,13,6,"So that the land coulde not beare them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they coulde not dwell together."
"326",326,"Genesis",1,13,7,"Also there was debate betweene ye heardmen of Abrams cattell, & the heardmen of Lots cattell. (and the Canaanites and the Perizzites dwelled at that time in the land.)"
"327",327,"Genesis",1,13,8,"Then saide Abram vnto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, betweene thee and me, neither betweene mine heardmen & thine heardmen: for we be brethren."
"328",328,"Genesis",1,13,9,"Is not the whole land before thee? depart I pray thee from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will goe to the right: or if thou goe to the right hand, then I will take the left."
"329",329,"Genesis",1,13,10,"So when Lot lifted vp his eyes, he saw that all the plaine of Iorden was watered euery where: (for before the Lorde destroyed Sodom and Gomorah, it was as the garden of the Lorde, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest vnto Zoar)"
"330",330,"Genesis",1,13,11,"Then Lot chose vnto him all the plaine of Iorden, and tooke his iourney from the East: and they departed the one from the other."
"331",331,"Genesis",1,13,12,"Abram dwelled in the lande of Canaan, and Lot abode in the cities of the plaine, and pitched his tent euen to Sodom."
"332",332,"Genesis",1,13,13,"Now the men of Sodom were wicked and exceeding sinners against the Lord."
"333",333,"Genesis",1,13,14,"Then the Lord saide vnto Abram, (after that Lot was departed from him) Lift vp thine eyes nowe, and looke from the place where thou art, Northward, and Southward, and Eastwarde, and Westward:"
"334",334,"Genesis",1,13,15,"For all the land, which thou seest, will I giue vnto thee and to thy seede for euer,"
"335",335,"Genesis",1,13,16,"And I will make thy seede, as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seede be numbred."
"336",336,"Genesis",1,13,17,"Arise, walke through the land, in ye length thereof, and breadth thereof: for I will giue it vnto thee."
"337",337,"Genesis",1,13,18,"Then Abram remoued his tent, and came and dwelled in the plaine of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and builded there an altar vnto ye Lorde."
"338",338,"Genesis",1,14,1,"And in the dayes of Amraphel King of Shinar, Arioch King of Ellasar, Chedor-laomer King of Elam, and Tidal king of the nations:"
"339",339,"Genesis",1,14,2,"These men made warre with Bera King of Sodom, and with Birsha King of Gomorah, Shinab King of Admah, and Shemeber King of Zeboiim, and the King of Bela, which is Zoar."
"340",340,"Genesis",1,14,3,"All these ioyned together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt Sea."
"341",341,"Genesis",1,14,4,"Twelue yeere were they subiect to Chedor-laomer, but in the thirteenth yeere they rebelled."
"342",342,"Genesis",1,14,5,"And in the fourteenth yeere came Chedor-laomer, and the Kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaueh Kiriathaim,"
"343",343,"Genesis",1,14,6,"And the Horites in their mount Seir, vnto the plaine of Paran, which is by the wildernesse."
"344",344,"Genesis",1,14,7,"And they returned and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the countrey of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelled in Hazezon-tamar."
"345",345,"Genesis",1,14,8,"Then went out the King of Sodom, and the King of Gomorah, and the King of Admah, and the King of Zeboiim, and the King of Bela, which is Zoar: and they ioyned battell with them in the vale of Siddim:"
"346",346,"Genesis",1,14,9,"To wit, with Chedor-laomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar: foure Kings against fiue."
"347",347,"Genesis",1,14,10,"Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits, & the Kings of Sodom & Gomorah fled and fell there: and ye residue fled to the mountaine."
"348",348,"Genesis",1,14,11,"Then they tooke all the substance of Sodom and Gomorah, and al their vitailes and went their way."
"349",349,"Genesis",1,14,12,"They tooke Lot also Abrams brothers sonne and his substance (for he dwelt at Sodom) and departed."
"350",350,"Genesis",1,14,13,"Then came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Ebrew, which dwelt in the plaine of Mamre ye Amorite, brother of Eshcol, & brother of Aner, which were confederat with Abram."
"351",351,"Genesis",1,14,14,"When Abram heard that his brother was taken, he brought forth of them that were borne and brought vp in his house, three hundreth and eighteene, and pursued them vnto Dan."
"352",352,"Genesis",1,14,15,"Then he, and his seruants deuided them selues against them by night, & smote them and pursued them vnto Hobah, which is on the left side of Damascus,"
"353",353,"Genesis",1,14,16,"And he recouered all the substance, and also brought againe his brother Lot, & his goods, and the women also and the people."
"354",354,"Genesis",1,14,17,"After that he returned from the slaughter of Chedor-laomer, and of the Kings that were with him, came the King of Sodom foorth to meete him in the valley of Shaueh, which is the Kings dale."
"355",355,"Genesis",1,14,18,"And Melchi-zedek King of Shalem brought foorth bread and wine: and he was a Priest of the most high God."
"356",356,"Genesis",1,14,19,"Therefore he blessed him, saying, Blessed art thou, Abram, of God most high possessour of heauen and earth,"
"357",357,"Genesis",1,14,20,"And blessed be the most high God, which hath deliuered thine enemies into thine hand. And Abram gaue him tythe of all."
"358",358,"Genesis",1,14,21,"Then the King of Sodom saide to Abram, Giue me the persons, and take the goodes to thy selfe."
"359",359,"Genesis",1,14,22,"And Abram said to the King of Sodom, I haue lift vp mine hand vnto the Lorde the most hie God possessor of heauen and earth,"
"360",360,"Genesis",1,14,23,"That I will not take of all that is thine, so much as a threde or shoolatchet, lest thou shouldest say, I haue made Abram riche,"
"361",361,"Genesis",1,14,24,"Saue onely that, which the yong men haue eaten, and the partes of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre: let them take their partes."
"362",362,"Genesis",1,15,1,"After these things, the worde of the Lorde came vnto Abram in a vision, saying, Feare not, Abram, I am thy buckler, and thine exceeding great reward."
"363",363,"Genesis",1,15,2,"And Abram said, O Lord God, what wilt thou giue me, seeing I goe childlesse, and the steward of mine house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"
"364",364,"Genesis",1,15,3,"Againe Abram saide, Beholde, to me thou hast giuen no seede: wherefore loe, a seruant of mine house shalbe mine heire."
"365",365,"Genesis",1,15,4,"Then beholde, the worde of the Lorde came vnto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heire, but one that shall come out of thine owne bowels, he shalbe thine heire."
"366",366,"Genesis",1,15,5,"Moreouer he brought him forth and said, Looke vp nowe vnto heauen, and tell ye starres, if thou be able to number them: and he said vnto him, So shall thy seede be."
"367",367,"Genesis",1,15,6,"And Abram beleeued the Lorde, and he counted that to him for righteousnesse."
"368",368,"Genesis",1,15,7,"Againe he saide vnto him, I am the Lord, that brought thee out of Vr of the Caldees, to giue thee this land to inherite it."
"369",369,"Genesis",1,15,8,"And he said, O Lord God, whereby shall I knowe that I shall inherite it?"
"370",370,"Genesis",1,15,9,"Then he said vnto him, Take me an heifer of three yeeres olde, and a shee goate of three yeeres olde, and a ramme of three yeeres olde, a turtle doue also and a pigeon."
"371",371,"Genesis",1,15,10,"So he tooke all these vnto him, and deuided them into the middes, & laid euery piece one against an other: but the birdes deuided he not."
"372",372,"Genesis",1,15,11,"Then foules fell on the carkases, and Abram droue them away."
"373",373,"Genesis",1,15,12,"And when the sunne went downe, there fell an heauie sleepe vpon Abram: and loe, a very fearefull darkenes fell vpon him."
"374",374,"Genesis",1,15,13,"Then he saide to Abram, Knowe for a suretie, that thy seede shalbe a stranger in a land, that is not theirs, foure hundreth yeeres, and shall serue them: & they shall intreate them euill."
"375",375,"Genesis",1,15,14,"Notwithstanding the nation, whom they shall serue, will I iudge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."

"377",377,"Genesis",1,15,16,"And in the fourth generation they shall come hither againe: for the wickednes of the Amorites is not yet full."
"378",378,"Genesis",1,15,17,"Also when the sunne went downe, there was a darkenes: & behold, a smoking fornace, and a firebrand, which went betweene those pieces."
"379",379,"Genesis",1,15,18,"In that same day the Lord made a couenant with Abram, saying, Vnto thy seede haue I giuen this lande, from the riuer of Egypt vnto the great riuer, the riuer Euphrates."

"384",384,"Genesis",1,16,2,"And Sarai said vnto Abram, Beholde now, the Lorde hath restrained me from childe bearing. I pray thee goe in vnto my maide: it may be that I shall receiue a childe by her; Abram obeyed the voyce of Sarai."

"388",388,"Genesis",1,16,6,"Then Abram saide to Sarai, Beholde, thy maide is in thine hand: doe with her as it pleaseth thee. Then Sarai dealt roughly with her: wherefore she fled from her."
"389",389,"Genesis",1,16,7,"But the Angel of the Lord founde her beside a fountaine of water in the wildernesse by the fountaine in the way to Shur,"

"407",407,"Genesis",1,17,9,"Againe God said vnto Abraham, Thou also shalt keepe my couenant, thou, and thy seede after thee in their generations."
"408",408,"Genesis",1,17,10,"This is my couenant which ye shall keepe betweene me & you, & thy seede after thee, Let euery man childe among you be circumcised:"

"413",413,"Genesis",1,17,15,"Afterward God said vnto Abraham, Sarai thy wife shalt thou not call Sarai, but Sarah shalbe her name."
"414",414,"Genesis",1,17,16,"And I will blesse her, & will also giue thee a sonne of her, yea, I will blesse her, and she shall be the mother of nations: Kings also of people shall come of her."
"415",415,"Genesis",1,17,17,"Then Abraham fell vpon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a childe be borne vnto him, that is an hundreth yeere olde? and shall Sarah that is ninetie yeere olde beare?"

"467",467,"Genesis",1,19,9,"Then they said, Away hence, and they said, He is come alone as a stranger, and shall he iudge and rule? We will nowe deale worse with thee then with them. So they preassed sore vpon Lot himselfe, and came to breake the doore."
"468",468,"Genesis",1,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand and pulled Lot into the house to them & shut to ye doore."
"469",469,"Genesis",1,19,11,"Then they smote the men that were at the doore of the house with blindnes both small and great, so that they were wearie in seeking the doore."
"470",470,"Genesis",1,19,12,"Then the men said vnto Lot, Whom hast thou yet here? Either sonne in lawe, or thy sonnes, or thy daughters, or whatsoeuer thou hast in the citie, bring it out of this place."
"471",471,"Genesis",1,19,13,"For we will destroy this place, because the crye of them is great before the Lorde, and the Lord hath sent vs to destroy it."
"472",472,"Genesis",1,19,14,"Then Lot went out and spake vnto his sonnes in lawe, which maried his daughters, and said, Arise, get you out of this place: for the Lord will destroy the citie: but he seemed to his sonnes in lawe as though he had mocked."
"473",473,"Genesis",1,19,15,"And when the morning arose, the Angels hasted Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be destroyed in the punishment of the citie."
"474",474,"Genesis",1,19,16,"And as he prolonged the time, the men caught both him and his wife, and his two daughters by the hands (the Lord being mercifull vnto him) and they brought him foorth, and set him without the citie."
"475",475,"Genesis",1,19,17,"And when they had brought them out, the Angel said, Escape for thy life: looke not behinde thee, neither tarie thou in all the plaine: escape into ye mountaine, least thou be destroyed."
"476",476,"Genesis",1,19,18,"And Lot saide vnto them, Not so, I pray thee, my Lord."
"477",477,"Genesis",1,19,19,"Behold now, thy seruant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercie, which thou hast shewed vnto me in sauing my life: and I cannot escape in the mountaine, least some euill take me, and I die."
"478",478,"Genesis",1,19,20,"See nowe this citie hereby to flee vnto, which is a litle one: Oh let me escape thither: is it not a litle one, and my soule shall liue?"
"479",479,"Genesis",1,19,21,"Then he said vnto him, Beholde, I haue receiued thy request also concerning this thing, that I will not ouerthrow this citie, for the which thou hast spoken."
"480",480,"Genesis",1,19,22,"Haste thee, saue thee there: for I can doe nothing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the citie was called Zoar."
"481",481,"Genesis",1,19,23,"The sunne did rise vpon the earth, when Lot entred into Zoar."
"482",482,"Genesis",1,19,24,"Then the Lord rained vpon Sodom and vpon Gomorah brimstone, & fire from the Lord out of heauen,"
"483",483,"Genesis",1,19,25,"And ouerthrewe those cities and all the plaine, and all the inhabitants of the cities; and that that grewe vpon the earth."
"484",484,"Genesis",1,19,26,"Now his wife behind him looked backe, and she became a pillar of salt."
"485",485,"Genesis",1,19,27,"And Abraham rising vp earely in ye morning went to the place, where he had stand before the Lord,"
"486",486,"Genesis",1,19,28,"And looking towarde Sodom and Gomorah and toward all the land of the plaine, behold, he sawe the smoke of the lande mounting vp as the smoke of a fornace."
"487",487,"Genesis",1,19,29,"But yet when God destroyed the cities of the plaine, God thought vpon Abraham, and sent Lot out from the middes of the destruction, when he ouerthrewe the cities, wherein Lot dwelled."
"488",488,"Genesis",1,19,30,"Then Lot went vp from Zoar, & dwelt in the mountaine with his two daughters: for he feared to tarie in Zoar, but dwelt in a caue, he, and his two daughters."
"489",489,"Genesis",1,19,31,"And the elder saide vnto the yonger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth, to come in vnto vs after the maner of all ye earth."
"490",490,"Genesis",1,19,32,"Come, wee will make our father drinke wine, and lie with him, that we may preserue seede of our father."
"491",491,"Genesis",1,19,33,"So they made their father drinke wine that night, and the elder went and lay with her father: but he perceiued not, neither whe she lay downe, neither when she rose vp."
"492",492,"Genesis",1,19,34,"And on the morowe the elder saide to the yonger, Behold, yester night lay I with my father: let vs make him drinke wine this night also, and goe thou and lie with him, that we may preserue seede of our father."
"493",493,"Genesis",1,19,35,"So they made their father drinke wine that night also, and the yonger arose, & lay with him, but he perceiued not, when she lay downe, neither when she rose vp."
"494",494,"Genesis",1,19,36,"Thus were both the daughters of Lot with childe by their father."
"495",495,"Genesis",1,19,37,"And the elder bare a sonne, and she called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites vnto this day."
"496",496,"Genesis",1,19,38,"And the yonger bare a sonne also, and she called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the Ammonites vnto this day."
"497",497,"Genesis",1,20,1,"Afterward Abraham departed thence toward the South countrey and dwelled betweene Cadesh and Shur, and soiourned in Gerar."
"498",498,"Genesis",1,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. Then Abimelech King of Gerar sent and tooke Sarah."
"499",499,"Genesis",1,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dreame by night, and said to him, Beholde, thou art but dead, because of the woman, which thou hast taken: for she is a mans wife."
"500",500,"Genesis",1,20,4,"(Notwithstanding Abimelech had not yet come neere her) And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay euen the righteous nation?"
"501",501,"Genesis",1,20,5,"Said not he vnto me, She is my sister? yea, and she her selfe said, He is my brother: with an vpright minde, and innocent handes haue I done this."
"502",502,"Genesis",1,20,6,"And God saide vnto him by a dreame, I knowe that thou diddest this euen with an vpright minde, and I kept thee also that thou shouldest not sinne against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touche her."
"503",503,"Genesis",1,20,7,"Now then deliuer the man his wife againe: for he is a Prophet, and he shall pray for thee that thou mayest liue: but if thou deliuer her not againe, be sure that thou shalt die the death, thou, and all that thou hast."
"504",504,"Genesis",1,20,8,"Then Abimelech rising vp early in ye morning, called all his seruants, and tolde all these things vnto them, and the men were sore afraid."
"505",505,"Genesis",1,20,9,"Afterward Abimelech called Abraham, and said vnto him, What hast thou done vnto vs? and what haue I offeded thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdome this great sinne? thou hast done things vnto me that ought not to be done."
"506",506,"Genesis",1,20,10,"So Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What sawest thou that thou hast done this thing?"
"507",507,"Genesis",1,20,11,"Then Abraha answered, Because I thought thus, Surely the feare of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wiues sake."
"508",508,"Genesis",1,20,12,"Yet in very deede she is my sister: for she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she is my wife."
"509",509,"Genesis",1,20,13,"Nowe when God caused me to wander out of my fathers house, I said then to her, This is thy kindnes that thou shalt shewe vnto me in all places where we come, Say thou of me, He is my brother."
"510",510,"Genesis",1,20,14,"Then tooke Abimelech sheepe & beeues, & men seruants, & women seruants, & gaue them vnto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife."
"511",511,"Genesis",1,20,15,"And Abimelech saide, Beholde, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee."
"512",512,"Genesis",1,20,16,"Likewise to Sarah he said, Beholde, I haue giuen thy brother a thousand pieces of siluer: behold, he is the vaile of thine eyes to all that are with thee, and to all others: and she was thus reproued."
"513",513,"Genesis",1,20,17,"Then Abraham prayed vnto God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his women seruants: and they bare children."
"514",514,"Genesis",1,20,18,"For the Lorde had shut vp euery wombe of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abrahams wife."
"515",515,"Genesis",1,21,1,"Nowe the Lord visited Sarah, as he had saide, and did vnto her according as he had promised."
"516",516,"Genesis",1,21,2,"For Sarah conceiued, and bare Abraham a sonne in his olde age, at the same season that God tolde him."
"517",517,"Genesis",1,21,3,"And Abraham called his sonnes name that was borne vnto him, which Sarah bare him, Izhak."
"518",518,"Genesis",1,21,4,"Then Abraha circumcised Izhak his sonne, when he was eight dayes olde, as God had commanded him."
"519",519,"Genesis",1,21,5,"So Abraham was an hundreth yeere olde, when his sonne Izhak was borne vnto him."
"520",520,"Genesis",1,21,6,"Then Sarah said, God hath made me to reioyce: all that heare will reioyce with me."
"521",521,"Genesis",1,21,7,"Againe she said, Who would haue saide to Abraham, that Sarah shoulde haue giuen children sucke? for I haue borne him a sonne in his olde age."
"522",522,"Genesis",1,21,8,"Then the childe grewe and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Izhak was weaned."
"523",523,"Genesis",1,21,9,"And Sarah sawe the sonne of Hagar the Egyptian (which she had borne vnto Abraham) mocking."
"524",524,"Genesis",1,21,10,"Wherefore she saide vnto Abraham, Cast out this bond woman and her sonne: for ye sonne of this bonde woman shall not be heire with my sonne Izhak."
"525",525,"Genesis",1,21,11,"And this thing was very grieuous in Abrahams sight, because of his sonne."
"526",526,"Genesis",1,21,12,"But God said vnto Abraham, Let it not be grieuous in thy sight for the childe, and for thy bonde woman: in all that Sarah shall say vnto thee, heare her voyce: for in Izhak shall thy seede be called."
"527",527,"Genesis",1,21,13,"As for the sonne of the bond woman, I will make him a nation also, because he is thy seede."
"528",528,"Genesis",1,21,14,"So Abraham arose vp early in ye morning, and tooke bread, and a bottell of water, and gaue it vnto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the childe also, and sent her away: who departing wandred in the wildernesse of Beer-sheba."
"529",529,"Genesis",1,21,15,"And when the water of the bottell was spent, she cast the childe vnder a certaine tree."
"530",530,"Genesis",1,21,16,"Then she went and sate her ouer against him a farre off about a bowe shoote: for she said, I will not see the death of the child; she sate downe ouer against him, and lift vp her voyce and wept."
"531",531,"Genesis",1,21,17,"Then God heard the voyce of ye childe, and the Angel of God called to Hagar from heauen, and said vnto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? feare not, for God hath heard the voyce of the childe where he is."
"532",532,"Genesis",1,21,18,"Arise, take vp the childe, and holde him in thine hand: for I will make of him a great people."
"533",533,"Genesis",1,21,19,"And God opened her eyes, and she sawe a well of water. so she went and filled the bottell with water, and gaue the boy drinke."
"534",534,"Genesis",1,21,20,"So God was with the childe, and he grewe and dwelt in the wildernesse, and was an archer."
"535",535,"Genesis",1,21,21,"And he dwelt in the wildernesse of Paran, and his mother tooke him a wife out of the land of Egypt."
"536",536,"Genesis",1,21,22,"And at that same time Abimelech and Phichol his chief captaine spake vnto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest."
"537",537,"Genesis",1,21,23,"Nowe therefore sweare vnto me here by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my children, nor my childrens children: thou shalt deale with me, and with the countrey, where thou hast bene a stranger, according vnto the kindnesse that I haue shewed thee."
"538",538,"Genesis",1,21,24,"Then Abraham said, I will sweare."
"539",539,"Genesis",1,21,25,"And Abraham rebuked Abimelech for a well of water, which Abimelechs seruants had violently taken away."
"540",540,"Genesis",1,21,26,"And Abimelech saide, I knowe not who hath done this thing: also thou toldest me not, neither heard I of it but this day."
"541",541,"Genesis",1,21,27,"Then Abraham tooke sheepe and beeues, and gaue them vnto Abimelech: and they two made a couenant."
"542",542,"Genesis",1,21,28,"And Abraham set seuen lambes of the flocke by themselues."
"543",543,"Genesis",1,21,29,"Then Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What meane these seuen lambes, which thou hast set by themselues?"
"544",544,"Genesis",1,21,30,"And he answered, Because thou shalt receiue of mine hand these seuen lambes, that it may be a witnes vnto me, that I haue digged this well."
"545",545,"Genesis",1,21,31,"Wherefore the place is called Beer-sheba, because there they both sware."
"546",546,"Genesis",1,21,32,"Thus made they a couenant at Beer-sheba: afterward Abimelech and Phichol his chiefe captaine rose vp, and turned againe vnto the land of the Philistims."
"547",547,"Genesis",1,21,33,"And Abraham planted a groue in Beer-sheba, and called there on the Name of ye Lord, the euerlasting God."
"548",548,"Genesis",1,21,34,"And Abraham was a stranger in the Philistims land a long season."
"549",549,"Genesis",1,22,1,"And after these things God did proue Abraham, and said vnto him, Abraham. Who answered, Here am I."
"550",550,"Genesis",1,22,2,"And he said, Take nowe thine onely sonne Izhak whom thou louest, and get thee vnto the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering vpon one of the mountaines, which I will shewe thee."
"551",551,"Genesis",1,22,3,"Then Abraham rose vp early in the morning, and sadled his asse, and tooke two of his seruants with him, and Izhak his sonne, and cloue wood for the burnt offering, and rose vp & went to the place, which God had tolde him."
"552",552,"Genesis",1,22,4,"Then the third day Abraham lift vp his eyes, and sawe the place afarre off,"
"553",553,"Genesis",1,22,5,"And said vnto his seruants, Abide you here with the asse: for I and the childe will go yonder and worship, and come againe vnto you."
"554",554,"Genesis",1,22,6,"Then Abraham tooke the wood of the burnt offering, and layed it vpon Izhak his sonne, and he tooke the fire in his hand, and the knife: and they went both together."
"555",555,"Genesis",1,22,7,"Then spake Izhak vnto Abraham his father, and said, My father; he answered, Here am I, my sonne; he said, Behold the fire & the wood, but where is the lambe for ye burnt offring?"
"556",556,"Genesis",1,22,8,"Then Abraham answered, My sonne, God will prouide him a lambe for a burnt offering: so they went both together."
"557",557,"Genesis",1,22,9,"And when they came to the place which God had shewed him, Abraham builded an altar there, & couched ye wood, and bound Izhak his sonne and laid him on the altar vpon the wood."
"558",558,"Genesis",1,22,10,"And Abraham stretching forth his hand, tooke the knife to kill his sonne."
"559",559,"Genesis",1,22,11,"But the Angel of the Lord called vnto him from heauen, saying, Abraham, Abraham; he answered, Here am I."
"560",560,"Genesis",1,22,12,"Then he said, Lay not thine hand vpon the childe, neither doe any thing vnto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing for my sake thou hast not spared thine onely sonne."
"561",561,"Genesis",1,22,13,"And Abraham lifting vp his eyes, looked: and behold, there was a ramme behind him caught by the hornes in a bush. then Abraham went and tooke the ramme, and offered him vp for a burnt offering in the steade of his sonne."
"562",562,"Genesis",1,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of that place, Iehouah-ijreh. as it is said this day, In the mount will the Lord be seene."
"563",563,"Genesis",1,22,15,"And the Angel of the Lorde cryed vnto Abraham from heauen the second time,"
"564",564,"Genesis",1,22,16,"And saide, By my selfe haue I sworne (saith ye Lord) because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thine onely sonne,"
"565",565,"Genesis",1,22,17,"Therefore will I surely blesse thee, and will greatly multiplie thy seede, as the starres of the heauen, and as the sand which is vpon the sea shore, and thy seede shall possesse the gate of his enemies."
"566",566,"Genesis",1,22,18,"And in thy seede shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voyce."
"567",567,"Genesis",1,22,19,"Then turned Abraham againe vnto his seruants, and they rose vp & went together to Beer-sheba: and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba."
"568",568,"Genesis",1,22,20,"And after these things one tolde Abraham, saying, Beholde Milcah, she hath also borne children vnto thy brother Nahor:"
"569",569,"Genesis",1,22,21,"To wit, Vz his eldest sonne, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
"570",570,"Genesis",1,22,22,"And Chesed and Hazo, and Pildash, and Iidlaph, and Bethuel."
"571",571,"Genesis",1,22,23,"And Bethuel begate Rebekah: these eight did Milcah beare to Nahor Abrahams brother."
"572",572,"Genesis",1,22,24,"And his concubine called Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gahan, and Thahash and Maachah."
"573",573,"Genesis",1,23,1,"When Sarah was an hundreth twentie and seuen yeere olde ( so long liued she)."
"574",574,"Genesis",1,23,2,"Then Sarah dyed in Kiriath-arba: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan; Abraham came to mourne for Sarah and to weepe for her."
"575",575,"Genesis",1,23,3,"Then Abraham rose vp from the sight of his corps, & talked with the Hittites, saying,"
"576",576,"Genesis",1,23,4,"I am a stranger, & a forreiner among you, giue me a possession of buriall with you, that I may burie my dead out of my sight."
"577",577,"Genesis",1,23,5,"Then the Hittites answered Abraham, saying vnto him,"
"578",578,"Genesis",1,23,6,"Heare vs, my lorde: thou art a prince of God among vs: in the chiefest of our sepulchres bury thy dead: none of vs shall forbid thee his sepulchre, but thou mayest bury thy dead therein."
"579",579,"Genesis",1,23,7,"Then Abraham stoode vp, and bowed him selfe before the people of the land of the Hittites."
"580",580,"Genesis",1,23,8,"And he communed with them, saying, If it be your minde, that I shall bury my dead out of my sight, heare me, and intreate for me to Ephron the sonne of Zohar,"
"581",581,"Genesis",1,23,9,"That he would giue me ye caue of Machpelah, which he hath in the ende of his field: that he would giue it me for as much money as it is worth, for a possession to bury in among you."
"582",582,"Genesis",1,23,10,"(For Ephron dwelt among the Hittites) Then Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of all the Hittites that went in at the gates of his citie, saying,"
"583",583,"Genesis",1,23,11,"No, my Lorde, heare me: the fielde giue I thee, and the caue, that therein is, I giue it thee: euen in the presence of the sonnes of my people giue I it thee, to bury thy dead."
"584",584,"Genesis",1,23,12,"Then Abraham bowed himselfe before the people of the land,"
"585",585,"Genesis",1,23,13,"And spake vnto Ephron in the audience of the people of the countrey, saying, Seeing thou wilt giue it, I pray thee, heare me, I will giue the price of the fielde: receiue it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
"586",586,"Genesis",1,23,14,"Ephron then answered Abraham, saying vnto him,"
"587",587,"Genesis",1,23,15,"My lord, hearken vnto me: ye land is worth foure hundreth shekels of siluer: what is that betweene me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."
"588",588,"Genesis",1,23,16,"So Abraham hearkened vnto Ephron, and Abraham weyed to Ephron the siluer, which he had named, in the audience of the Hittites, euen foure hundreth siluer shekels of currant money among marchants."
"589",589,"Genesis",1,23,17,"So the fielde of Ephron which was in Machpelah, and ouer against Mamre, euen the field and the caue that was therein, and all the trees that were in the fielde, which were in all the borders round about, was made sure"
"590",590,"Genesis",1,23,18,"Vnto Abraham for a possession, in ye sight of the Hittites, euen of all that went in at the gates of his citie."
"591",591,"Genesis",1,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the caue of the fielde of Machpelah ouer against Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan."
"592",592,"Genesis",1,23,20,"Thus the fielde and the caue, that is therein, was made sure vnto Abraham for a possession of buriall by the Hittites."
"593",593,"Genesis",1,24,1,"Nowe Abraham was olde, and striken in yeeres, and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things."
"594",594,"Genesis",1,24,2,"Therefore Abraham saide vnto his eldest seruant of his house, which had the rule ouer all that he had, Put nowe thine hand vnder my thigh,"
"595",595,"Genesis",1,24,3,"And I will make thee sweare by ye Lorde God of the heauen, and God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife vnto my sonne of the daughters of the Canaanites among who I dwel."
"596",596,"Genesis",1,24,4,"But thou shalt go vnto my countrey, and to my kinred, & take a wife vnto my sone Izhak."
"597",597,"Genesis",1,24,5,"And the seruant saide to him, What if the woman will not come with me to this land? Shall I bring thy sonne againe vnto the lande from whence thou camest?"
"598",598,"Genesis",1,24,6,"To whom Abraham answered, Beware that thou bring not my sonne thither againe."
"599",599,"Genesis",1,24,7,"The Lord God of heauen, who tooke me from my fathers house, and from the land where I was borne, and that spake vnto me, and that sware vnto me, saying, Vnto thy seede wil I giue this land, he shall send his Angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife vnto my sonne fro thence."
"600",600,"Genesis",1,24,8,"Neuertheles if the woman wil not followe thee, then shalt thou bee discharged of this mine othe: onely bring not my sonne thither againe."
"601",601,"Genesis",1,24,9,"Then the seruant put his hand vnder the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him for this matter."
"602",602,"Genesis",1,24,10,"So the seruant tooke ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed: (for he had all his masters goods in his hand:) and so he arose, and went to Aram Naharaim, vnto the citie of Nahor."
"603",603,"Genesis",1,24,11,"And he made his camels to lye downe without the citie by a well of water, at euentide about the time that the women come out to draw water."
"604",604,"Genesis",1,24,12,"And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, I beseech thee, send me good speede this day, & shew mercy vnto my master Abraha."
"605",605,"Genesis",1,24,13,"Lo, I stand by the well of water, whiles the mens daughters of this citie come out to drawe water."
"606",606,"Genesis",1,24,14,"Graunt therefore that ye maide, to whom I say, Bowe downe thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drinke: if she say, Drinke, and I will giue thy camels drinke also: may be she that thou hast ordeined for thy seruant Izhak: and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed mercy on my master."
"607",607,"Genesis",1,24,15,"And nowe yer he had left speaking, beholde, Rebekah came out, the daughter of Bethuel, sonne of Milcah the wife of Nahor Abrahams brother, and her pitcher vpon her shoulder."
"608",608,"Genesis",1,24,16,"(And the maide was very faire to looke vpon, a virgine and vnknowen of man) and she went downe to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came vp."
"609",609,"Genesis",1,24,17,"Then the seruant ranne to meete her, and said, Let me drinke, I pray thee, a litle water of thy pitcher."
"610",610,"Genesis",1,24,18,"And she said, Drinke sir: and she hasted, and let downe her pitcher vpon her hand and gaue him drinke."
"611",611,"Genesis",1,24,19,"And when she had giuen him drinke, she said, I will drawe water for thy camels also vntill they haue drunken inough."
"612",612,"Genesis",1,24,20,"And she powred out her pitcher into the trough speedily; and ranne againe vnto the well to drawe water, and she drewe for all his camels."
"613",613,"Genesis",1,24,21,"So the man wondred at her, and helde his peace, to knowe whether the Lord had made his iourney prosperous or not."
"614",614,"Genesis",1,24,22,"And when the camels had left drinking, the man tooke a golden abillement of halfe a shekell weight, and two bracelets for her hands, of ten shekels weight of golde:"
"615",615,"Genesis",1,24,23,"And he said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee, Is there roume in thy fathers house for vs to lodge in?"
"616",616,"Genesis",1,24,24,"Then she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the sonne of Milcah whom she bare vnto Nahor."

"623",623,"Genesis",1,24,31,"And he saide, Come in thou blessed of the Lord: wherefore standest thou without, seeing I haue prepared the house, & roume for ye camels?"

"634",634,"Genesis",1,24,42,"So I came this day to the well, and said, O Lorde, the God of my master Abraham, if thou nowe prosper my iourney which I goe,"
"635",635,"Genesis",1,24,43,"Behold, I stand by the wel of water: when a virgine commeth forth to drawe water, and I say to her, Giue me, I pray thee, a litle water of thy pitcher to drinke,"

"656",656,"Genesis",1,24,64,"Also Rebekah lift vp her eyes, & when she saw Izhak, she lighted downe from the camel."
"657",657,"Genesis",1,24,65,"(For shee had sayde to the seruant, Who is yonder man, that commeth in the fielde to meete vs? and the seruant had said, It is my master) So she tooke a vaile, and couered her."
"658",658,"Genesis",1,24,66,"And the seruant tolde Izhak all things, that he had done."
"659",659,"Genesis",1,24,67,"Afterward Izhak brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and he tooke Rebekah, and she was his wife, and he loued her: So Izhak was comforted after his mothers death."
"660",660,"Genesis",1,25,1,"Nowe Abraham had taken him another wife called Keturah,"

"677",677,"Genesis",1,25,18,"And they dwelt from Hauilah vnto Shur, that is towardes Egypt, as thou goest to Asshur. Ishmael dwelt in the presence of all his brethren."
"678",678,"Genesis",1,25,19,"Likewise these are the generations of Izhak Abrahams sonne Abraham begate Izhak,"
"679",679,"Genesis",1,25,20,"And Izhak was fourtie yeere olde, when he tooke Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramite of Padan Aram, and sister to Laban the Aramite."
"680",680,"Genesis",1,25,21,"And Izhak prayed vuto the Lorde for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceiued,"
"681",681,"Genesis",1,25,22,"But the children stroue together within her: therefore shee sayde, Seeing it is so, why am I thus? wherefore she went to aske the Lord."
"682",682,"Genesis",1,25,23,"And the Lord sayd to her, Two nations are in thy wombe, and two maner of people shalbe diuided out of thy bowels, and the one people shall be mightier then the other, and the elder shall serue the yonger."
"683",683,"Genesis",1,25,24,"Therefore when her time of deliuerance was fulfilled, behold, twinnes were in her wombe."
"684",684,"Genesis",1,25,25,"So he that came out first was red, and he was all ouer as a rough garment, and they called his name Esau."
"685",685,"Genesis",1,25,26,"And afterward came his brother out, and his hande helde Esau by the heele: therefore his name was called Iaakob. Nowe Izhak was threescore yeere olde when Rebekah bare them."
"686",686,"Genesis",1,25,27,"And the boyes grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, and liued in the fields: but Iaakob was a plaine man, and dwelt in tentes."
"687",687,"Genesis",1,25,28,"And Izhak loued Esau, for venison was his meate, but Rebekah loued Iaakob."
"688",688,"Genesis",1,25,29,"Nowe Iaakob sod pottage, and Esau came from the fielde and was wearie."
"689",689,"Genesis",1,25,30,"Then Esau sayd to Iaakob, Let me eate, I pray thee, of that pottage so red, for I am wearie. Therefore was his name called Edom."

"693",693,"Genesis",1,25,34,"Then Iaakob gaue Esau bread and pottage of lentiles: and he did eate and drinke, and rose vp, and went his way: So Esau contemned his birthright."
"694",694,"Genesis",1,26,1,"And there was a famine in the lande besides the first famine that was in the dayes of Abraham. Wherefore Izhak went to Abimelech King of the Philistims vnto Gerar."
"695",695,"Genesis",1,26,2,"For the Lord appeared vnto him, and sayde, Goe not downe into Egypt, but abide in the land which I shall shewe vnto thee."
"696",696,"Genesis",1,26,3,"Dwell in this lande, and I will be with thee, and will blesse thee: for to thee, and to thy seede I will giue all these countreys: and I will performe the othe which I sware vnto Abraham thy father."

"699",699,"Genesis",1,26,6,"So Izhak dwelt in Gerar."
"700",700,"Genesis",1,26,7,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife, and he sayd, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife, least, sayde he, the men of the place shoulde kill me, because of Rebekah: for she was beautifull to the eye."
"701",701,"Genesis",1,26,8,"So after hee had bene there long time, Abimelech King of the Philistims looked out at a windowe, and loe, he sawe Izhak sporting with Rebekah his wife."
"702",702,"Genesis",1,26,9,"Then Abimelech called Izhak, and sayde, Loe, shee is of a suertie thy wife, and why saydest thou, She is my sister? To whom Izhak answered, Because I thought this, It may be that I shall dye for her."
"703",703,"Genesis",1,26,10,"Then Abimelech said, Why hast thou done this vnto vs? one of the people had almost lien by thy wife, so shouldest thou haue brought sinne vpon vs."
"704",704,"Genesis",1,26,11,"Then Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man, or his wife, shal die the death."
"705",705,"Genesis",1,26,12,"Afterwarde Izhak sowed in that lande, and founde in the same yeere an hundreth folde by estimation: and so the Lord blessed him."
"706",706,"Genesis",1,26,13,"And the man waxed mightie, and stil increased, till he was exceeding great,"
"707",707,"Genesis",1,26,14,"For he had flockes of sheepe, and heards of cattell, and a mightie housholde: therefore the Philistims had enuy at him."
"708",708,"Genesis",1,26,15,"In so much that the Philistims stopped and filled vp with earth all the welles, which his fathers seruantes digged in his father Abrahams time."
"709",709,"Genesis",1,26,16,"Then Abimelech sayde vnto Izhak, Get thee from vs, for thou art mightier then wee a great deale."
"710",710,"Genesis",1,26,17,"Therefore Izhak departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
"711",711,"Genesis",1,26,18,"And Izhak returning, digged the welles of water, which they had digged in the dayes of Abraham his father: for the Philistims had stopped them after the death of Abraham, and hee gaue them the same names, which his father gaue them."
"712",712,"Genesis",1,26,19,"Izhaks seruantes then digged in the valley, and found there a well of liuing water."
"713",713,"Genesis",1,26,20,"But the herdmen of Gerar did striue with Izhaks herdmen, saying, The water is ours: therefore called he the name of the wel Esek, because they were at strife with him."
"714",714,"Genesis",1,26,21,"Afterwarde they digged another well, and stroue for that also, and he called the name of it Sitnah."
"715",715,"Genesis",1,26,22,"Then he remoued thence, and digged an other well, for the which they stroue not: therefore called hee the name of it Rehoboth, and sayde, Because the Lorde hath nowe made vs roome, we shall increase vpon the earth."
"716",716,"Genesis",1,26,23,"So he went vp thence to Beer-sheba."
"717",717,"Genesis",1,26,24,"And the Lord appeared vnto him the same night, and sayde, I am the God of Abraham thy father: feare not, for I am with thee, and wil blesse thee, and will multiplie thy seede for my seruant Abrahams sake."
"718",718,"Genesis",1,26,25,"Then he builte an altar there, and called vpon the Name of the Lorde, and there spred his tent: where also Izhaks seruauntes digged a well."
"719",719,"Genesis",1,26,26,"Then came Abimelech to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friendes, and Phichol the captaine of his armie."
"720",720,"Genesis",1,26,27,"To whom Izhak sayd, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate mee and haue put mee away from you?"
"721",721,"Genesis",1,26,28,"Who answered, Wee sawe certainely that the Lorde was with thee, and wee thought thus, Let there be nowe an othe betweene vs, euen betweene vs and thee, and let vs make a couenant with thee."
"722",722,"Genesis",1,26,29,"If thou shalt do vs no hurt, as we haue not touched thee, and as we haue done vnto thee nothing but good, and sent thee away in peace: thou nowe, the blessed of the Lord, doe this."
"723",723,"Genesis",1,26,30,"Then hee made them a feast, and they dyd eate and drinke."
"724",724,"Genesis",1,26,31,"And they rose vp betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: then Izhak let them go, and they departed from him in peace."
"725",725,"Genesis",1,26,32,"And that same day Izhaks seruantes came and tolde him of a well, which they had digged, and said vnto him, We haue found water."
"726",726,"Genesis",1,26,33,"So hee called it Shibah: therefore the name of the citie is called Beer-sheba vnto this day."
"727",727,"Genesis",1,26,34,"Nowe when Esau was fourtie yeere olde, he tooke to wife Iudith, the daughter of Beeri an Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon an Hittite also."
"728",728,"Genesis",1,26,35,"And they were a griefe of minde to Izhak and to Rebekah."
"729",729,"Genesis",1,27,1,"And when Izhak was olde, and his eyes were dimme (so that he coulde not see) he called Esau his eldest sonne, and sayde vnto him, My sonne; he answered him, I am here."
"730",730,"Genesis",1,27,2,"Then he sayd, Beholde, I am nowe olde, and knowe not the day of my death:"
"731",731,"Genesis",1,27,3,"Wherefore nowe, I pray thee take thine instrumentes, thy quiuer and thy bowe, and get thee to the fielde, that thou mayest take mee some venison."
"732",732,"Genesis",1,27,4,"Then make mee sauourie meate, such as I loue, and bring it me that I may eat, and that my soule may blesse thee, before I die."
"733",733,"Genesis",1,27,5,"(Nowe Rebekah heard, when Izhak spake to Esau his sonne) and Esau went into the fielde to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
"734",734,"Genesis",1,27,6,"Then Rebekah spake vnto Iaakob her sonne, saying, Beholde, I haue heard thy father talking with Esau thy brother, saying,"
"735",735,"Genesis",1,27,7,"Bring mee venision, and make mee sauourie meate, that I may eate and blesse thee before the Lord, afore my death."
"736",736,"Genesis",1,27,8,"Nowe therefore, my sonne, heare my voyce in that which I command thee."
"737",737,"Genesis",1,27,9,"Get thee nowe to the flocke, and bring me thence two good kids of the goates, that I may make pleasant meate of them for thy father, such as he loueth."
"738",738,"Genesis",1,27,10,"Then shalt thou bring it to thy father, and he shal eate, to the intent that he may blesse thee before his death."
"739",739,"Genesis",1,27,11,"But Iaakob sayde to Rebekah his mother, Beholde, Esau my brother is rough, and I am smoothe."
"740",740,"Genesis",1,27,12,"My father may possibly feele me, and I shal seem to him to be a mocker: so shall I bring a curse vpon me, and not a blessing."
"741",741,"Genesis",1,27,13,"But his mother sayd vnto him, vpon me be thy curse, my sonne: onely heare my voyce, and go and bring me them."
"742",742,"Genesis",1,27,14,"So he went and set them, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made pleasant meat, such as his father loued."
"743",743,"Genesis",1,27,15,"And Rebekah tooke faire clothes of her elder sonne Esau, which were in her house, and clothed Iaakob her yonger sonne:"

"745",745,"Genesis",1,27,17,"Afterward she put the pleasant meate and bread, which she had prepared, in the hand of her sonne Iaakob."
"746",746,"Genesis",1,27,18,"And when he came to his father, he sayd, My father. Who answered, I am here: who art thou, my sonne?"
"747",747,"Genesis",1,27,19,"And Iaakob sayde to his father, I am Esau thy first borne, I haue done as thou badest me, arise, I pray thee: sit vp and eate of my venison, that thy soule may blesse me."
"748",748,"Genesis",1,27,20,"Then Izhak said vnto his sonne, Howe hast thou founde it so quickly my sonne? Who sayde, Because the Lorde thy God brought it to mine hande."
"749",749,"Genesis",1,27,21,"Againe sayde Izhak vnto Iaakob, Come neere nowe, that I may feele thee, my sonne, whether thou be that my sonne Esau or not."
"750",750,"Genesis",1,27,22,"Then Iaakob came neere to Izhak his father, and he felt him and sayd, The voyce is Iaakobs voyce, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
"751",751,"Genesis",1,27,23,"(For he knewe him not, because his hands were rough as his brother Esaus hands: wherefore he blessed him)"
"752",752,"Genesis",1,27,24,"Againe he sayd, Art thou that my sonne Esau? Who answered, Yea."
"753",753,"Genesis",1,27,25,"Then said he, Bring it me hither, and I will eate of my sonnes venison, that my soule may blesse thee; he brought it to him, and he ate: also he brought him wine, and he dranke."

"758",758,"Genesis",1,27,30,"And when Izhak had made an ende of blessing Iaakob, and Iaakob was scarce gone out from the presence of Izhak his father, then came Esau his brother from his hunting,"
"759",759,"Genesis",1,27,31,"And hee also prepared sauourie meate and brought it to his father, and sayd vnto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his sonnes venison, that thy soule may blesse me."

"762",762,"Genesis",1,27,34,"When Esau heard the wordes of his father, he cryed out with a great crye and bitter, out of measure, and sayde vnto his father, Blesse me, euen me also, my father."
"763",763,"Genesis",1,27,35,"Who answered, Thy brother came with subtiltie, and hath taken away thy blessing."
"764",764,"Genesis",1,27,36,"Then he sayde, Was hee not iustly called Iaakob? for hee hath deceiued mee these two times: he tooke my birthright, and loe, nowe hath he taken my blessing. Also he sayd, Hast thou not reserued a blessing for me?"
"765",765,"Genesis",1,27,37,"Then Izhak answered, and sayd vnto Esau, Beholde, I haue made him thy lorde, and all his brethre haue I made his seruants: also with wheate and wine haue I furnished him, & vnto thee now what shall I doe, my sonne?"
"766",766,"Genesis",1,27,38,"Then Esau sayde vnto his father, Hast thou but one blessing my father? blesse mee, euen me also, my father: and Esau lifted vp his voyce, and wept."
"767",767,"Genesis",1,27,39,"Then Izhak his father answered, and sayde vnto him, Behold, the fatnesse of the earth shal be thy dwelling place, and thou shalt haue of the dewe of heauen from aboue."
"768",768,"Genesis",1,27,40,"And by thy sword shalt thou liue, and shalt be thy brothers seruant. But it shall come to passe, when thou shalt get the masterie, that thou shalt breake his yoke from thy necke."
"769",769,"Genesis",1,27,41,"Therefore Esau hated Iaakob, because of the blessing, wherewith his father blessed him; Esau thought in his minde, The dayes of mourning for my father will come shortly, then I will slay may brother Iaakob."
"770",770,"Genesis",1,27,42,"And it was told to Rebekah of the wordes of Esau her elder sonne, and shee sent and called Iaakob her yonger sonne, and sayd vnto him, Beholde, thy brother Esau is comforted against thee, meaning to kill thee:"
"771",771,"Genesis",1,27,43,"Now therefore my sonne, heare my voyce, arise, & flee thou to Haran to my brother Laban,"
"772",772,"Genesis",1,27,44,"And tarie with him a while vntill thy brothers fiercenesse be swaged,"
"773",773,"Genesis",1,27,45,"And till thy brothers wrath turne away from thee, and hee forget the thinges, which thou hast done to him: then will I sende and take thee from thence: why shoulde I bee depriued of you both in one day?"
"774",774,"Genesis",1,27,46,"Also Rebekah said to Izhak, I am weary of my life, for the daughters of Heth. If Iaakob take a wife of the daughters of Heth like these of the daughters of the lande, what auaileth it me to liue?"
"775",775,"Genesis",1,28,1,"Then Izhak called Iaakob and blessed him, and charged him, and sayde vnto him, Take not a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
"776",776,"Genesis",1,28,2,"Arise, get thee to Padan Aram to the house of Bethuel thy mothers father, and thence take thee a wife of the daughters of Laban thy mothers brother."
"777",777,"Genesis",1,28,3,"And God all sufficient blesse thee, and make thee to encrease, and multiplie thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people,"
"778",778,"Genesis",1,28,4,"And giue thee the blessing of Abraham, euen to thee & to thy seede with thee, that thou mayest inherite the lande (wherein thou art a stranger,) which God gaue vnto Abraham."
"779",779,"Genesis",1,28,5,"Thus Izhak sent forth Iaakob, & he went to Padan Aram vnto Laban sonne of Bethuel the Aramite, brother to Rebekah, Iaakobs and Esaus mother."
"780",780,"Genesis",1,28,6,"When Esau sawe that Izhak had blessed Iaakob, and sent him to Padan Aram, to set him a wife thence, and giuen him a charge when he blessed him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,"
"781",781,"Genesis",1,28,7,"And that Iaakob had obeyed his father & his mother, and was gone to Padan Aram:"
"782",782,"Genesis",1,28,8,"Also Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan displeased Izhak his father,"
"783",783,"Genesis",1,28,9,"Then went Esau to Ishmael, & tooke vnto the wiues, which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahams sonne, the sister of Nabaioth, to be his wife."
"784",784,"Genesis",1,28,10,"Now Iaakob departed from Beer-sheba, and went to Haran,"
"785",785,"Genesis",1,28,11,"And he came vnto a certaine place, and taried there al night, because the sunne was downe, and tooke of the stones of the place, and layde vnder his head and slept in the same place."
"786",786,"Genesis",1,28,12,"Then he dreamed, & behold, there stoode a ladder vpon the earth, and the top of it reached vp to heauen: and loe, the Angels of God went vp and downe by it."
"787",787,"Genesis",1,28,13,"And behold, the Lord stoode aboue it, & sayd, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Izhak: the land, vpon the which thou sleepest, wil I giue thee and thy seede."
"788",788,"Genesis",1,28,14,"And thy seede shall be as the dust of the earth, & thou shalt spread abroad to the West, and to the East, & to the North, & to the South, and in thee and in thy seede shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
"789",789,"Genesis",1,28,15,"And lo, I am with thee, and wil keepe thee whithersoeuer thou goest, and will bring thee againe into this lande: for I will not forsake thee vntill I haue performed that, that I haue promised thee."
"790",790,"Genesis",1,28,16,"Then Iaakob awoke out of his sleepe, & sayde, Surely the Lorde is in this place, and I was not aware."
"791",791,"Genesis",1,28,17,"And he was afraid, & said, How fearefull is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heauen."
"792",792,"Genesis",1,28,18,"Then Iaakob rose vp early in the morning, and tooke the stone that hee had layde vnder his head, and set it vp as a pillar, and powred oyle vpon the top of it."
"793",793,"Genesis",1,28,19,"And he called ye name of that place Bethel: notwithstanding the name of the citie was at the first called Luz."
"794",794,"Genesis",1,28,20,"Then Iaakob vowed a vowe, saying, If God will be with me, and will keepe me in this iourney which I go, & wil giue me bread to eate, and clothes to put on:"
"795",795,"Genesis",1,28,21,"So that I come againe vnto my fathers house in safetie, then shal the Lord be my God."
"796",796,"Genesis",1,28,22,"And this stone, which I haue set vp as a pillar, shall be Gods house: and of all that thou shalt giue me, wil I giue the tenth vnto thee."
"797",797,"Genesis",1,29,1,"Then Iaakob lift vp his feete and came into the East countrey."
"798",798,"Genesis",1,29,2,"And as he looked about, behold there was a well in the field, and lo, three flocks of sheepe lay thereby (for at that well were the flockes watered) & there was a great stone vpon the welles mouth."
"799",799,"Genesis",1,29,3,"And thither were all the flockes gathered, & they rolled the stone from the welles mouth, and watered the sheepe, and put the stone againe vpon the welles mouth in his place."
"800",800,"Genesis",1,29,4,"And Iaakob sayde vnto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they answered, We are of Haran."
"801",801,"Genesis",1,29,5,"Then he sayd vnto them, Know ye Laban the sonne of Nahor? Who said, We know him."
"802",802,"Genesis",1,29,6,"Againe he sayd vnto them, Is he in good health? And they answered, He is in good health, and beholde, his daughter Rahel commeth with the sheepe."
"803",803,"Genesis",1,29,7,"Then he sayd, Lo, it is yet hie day, neither is it time that the cattell shoulde be gathered together: water ye the sheepe and go feede them."
"804",804,"Genesis",1,29,8,"But they sayde, We may not vntill all the flocks be brought together, and till men rolle the stone from the welles mouth, that we may water the sheepe."
"805",805,"Genesis",1,29,9,"While he talked with them, Rahel also came with her fathers sheepe, for she kept them."
"806",806,"Genesis",1,29,10,"And assoone as Iaakob saw Rahel ye daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheepe of Laban his mothers brother, then came Iaakob neere, & rolled the stone fro the welles mouth, & watered ye flocke of Laban his mothers brother."
"807",807,"Genesis",1,29,11,"And Iaakob kissed Rahel, and lift vp his voyce and wept."
"808",808,"Genesis",1,29,12,"(For Iaakob tolde Rahel, that he was her fathers brother, & that he was Rebekahs sonne) then she ranne and tolde her father."
"809",809,"Genesis",1,29,13,"And when Laban heard tell of Iaakob his sisters sonne, he ranne to meete him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house: and he tolde Laban all these things."
"810",810,"Genesis",1,29,14,"To whome Laban sayd, Well, thou art my bone and my flesh; he abode with him the space of a moneth."
"811",811,"Genesis",1,29,15,"For Laban sayde vnto Iaakob, Though thou be my brother, shouldest thou therfore serue me for nought? tell me, what shalbe thy wages?"
"812",812,"Genesis",1,29,16,"Now Laban had two daughters, the elder called Leah, and the yonger called Rahel."
"813",813,"Genesis",1,29,17,"And Leah was tender eyed, but Rahel was beautifull and faire."
"814",814,"Genesis",1,29,18,"And Iaakob loued Rahel, and sayde, I will serue thee seuen yeeres for Rahel thy yonger daughter."
"815",815,"Genesis",1,29,19,"Then Laban answered, It is better that I giue her thee, then that I should giue her to another man: abide with me."
"816",816,"Genesis",1,29,20,"And Iaakob serued seuen yeres for Rahel, and they seemed vnto him but a few dayes, because he loued her."
"817",817,"Genesis",1,29,21,"Then Iaakob sayde to Laban, Giue me my wife, that I may goe in to her: for my terme is ended."
"818",818,"Genesis",1,29,22,"Wherefore Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
"819",819,"Genesis",1,29,23,"But whe the euening was come, he tooke Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in vnto her."
"820",820,"Genesis",1,29,24,"And Laban gaue his mayde Zilpah to his daughter Leah, to be her seruant."
"821",821,"Genesis",1,29,25,"But when the morning was come, behold, it was Leah. Then sayde he to Laban, Wherefore hast thou done thus to mee? did not I serue thee for Rahel? wherfore then hast thou beguiled me?"
"822",822,"Genesis",1,29,26,"And Laban answered, It is not the maner of this place, to giue the yonger before the elder."
"823",823,"Genesis",1,29,27,"Fulfill seuen yeeres for her, and we wil also giue thee this for the seruice, which thou shalt serue me yet seuen yeeres more."
"824",824,"Genesis",1,29,28,"Then Iaakob did so, and fulfilled her seuen yeeres, so he gaue him Rahel his daughter to be his wife."
"825",825,"Genesis",1,29,29,"Laban also gaue to Rahel his daughter Bilhah his mayde to be her seruant."
"826",826,"Genesis",1,29,30,"So entred he in to Rahel also, and loued also Rahel more then Leah, and serued him yet seuen yeeres mo."
"827",827,"Genesis",1,29,31,"When the Lord saw that Leah was despised, he made her fruitful: but Rahel was barren."
"828",828,"Genesis",1,29,32,"And Leah conceiued & bare a sonne, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Because the Lord hath looked vpon my tribulation, now therefore mine husband will loue me."
"829",829,"Genesis",1,29,33,"And she conceiued againe & bare a sonne, and sayde, Because the Lord heard that I was hated, he hath therefore giuen me this sonne also, & she called his name Simeon."
"830",830,"Genesis",1,29,34,"And she conceiued againe & bare a sonne, and said, Now at this time wil my husband keepe mee company, because I haue borne him three sonnes: therefore was his name called Leui."
"831",831,"Genesis",1,29,35,"Moreouer shee conceiued againe and bare a sonne, saying, Nowe will I prayse the Lorde: therefore shee called his name Iudah, and left bearing."
"832",832,"Genesis",1,30,1,"And when Rahel saw that she bare Iaakob no children, Rahel enuied her sister, and said vnto Iaakob, Giue me children, or els I dye."
"833",833,"Genesis",1,30,2,"Then Iaakobs anger was kindled against Rahel, and he sayde, Am I in Gods steade, which hath withholden from thee the fruite of the wombe?"
"834",834,"Genesis",1,30,3,"And she said, Behold my maide Bilhah, goe in to her, and she shal beare vpon my knees, and I shal haue children also by her."
"835",835,"Genesis",1,30,4,"Then shee gaue him Bilhah her mayde to wife, and Iaakob went in to her."
"836",836,"Genesis",1,30,5,"So Bilhah conceiued and bare Iaakob a sonne."
"837",837,"Genesis",1,30,6,"Then said Rahel, God hath giuen sentence on my side, and hath also heard my voyce, and hath giuen mee a sonne: therefore called shee his name, Dan."
"838",838,"Genesis",1,30,7,"And Bilhah Rahels maide coceiued againe, and bare Iaakob the second sonne."
"839",839,"Genesis",1,30,8,"Then Rahel said, with excellent wrestlings haue I wrestled with my sister, & haue gotten the vpper hande: and shee called his name, Naphtali."
"840",840,"Genesis",1,30,9,"And when Leah saw that she had left bearing, shee tooke Zilpah her mayde, and gaue her Iaakob to wife."
"841",841,"Genesis",1,30,10,"And Zilpah Leahs mayde bare Iaakob a sonne."
"842",842,"Genesis",1,30,11,"Then sayd Leah, A companie commeth: and she called his name, Gad."
"843",843,"Genesis",1,30,12,"Againe Zilpah Leahs mayde bare Iaakob another sonne."
"844",844,"Genesis",1,30,13,"Then sayde Leah, Ah, blessed am I, for the daughters will blesse me; she called his name, Asher."
"845",845,"Genesis",1,30,14,"Nowe Reuben went in the dayes of the wheateharuest, and founde mandrakes in the fielde and brought them vnto his mother Leah. Then sayde Rahel to Leah, Giue me, I pray thee, of thy sonnes mandrakes."
"846",846,"Genesis",1,30,15,"But shee answered her, Is it a small matter for thee to take mine husband, except thou take my sonnes mandrakes also? Then sayde Rahel, Therefore he shall sleepe with thee this night for thy sonnes mandrakes."
"847",847,"Genesis",1,30,16,"And Iaakob came from the fielde in the euening, and Leah went out to meete him, and sayde, Come in to mee, for I haue bought and payed for thee with my sonnes mandrakes: and he slept with her that night."
"848",848,"Genesis",1,30,17,"And God heard Leah and shee conceiued, and bare vnto Iaakob the fift sonne."
"849",849,"Genesis",1,30,18,"Then said Leah, God hath giuen me my reward, because I gaue my mayde to my husband, and she called his name Issachar."
"850",850,"Genesis",1,30,19,"After, Leah conceiued againe, & bare Iaakob the sixt sonne."
"851",851,"Genesis",1,30,20,"Then Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowrie: nowe will mine husbande dwell with me, because I haue borne him sixe sonnes: & she called his name Zebulun."
"852",852,"Genesis",1,30,21,"After that, shee bare a daughter, and shee called her name Dinah."
"853",853,"Genesis",1,30,22,"And God remembred Rahel, and God heard her, and opened her wombe."
"854",854,"Genesis",1,30,23,"So she conceiued & bare a sonne, and said, God hath taken away my rebuke."
"855",855,"Genesis",1,30,24,"And shee called his name Ioseph, saying, The Lord wil giue me yet another sonne."
"856",856,"Genesis",1,30,25,"And assoone as Rahel had borne Ioseph, Iaakob said to Laban, Sende me away that I may go vnto my place and to my countrey."
"857",857,"Genesis",1,30,26,"Giue me my wiues and my children, for whom I haue serued thee, and let me go: for thou knowest what seruice I haue done thee."
"858",858,"Genesis",1,30,27,"To whom Laban answered, If I haue nowe found fauour in thy sight tarie: I haue perceiued that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake."
"859",859,"Genesis",1,30,28,"Also he said, Appoynt vnto me thy wages, and I will giue it thee."
"860",860,"Genesis",1,30,29,"But he sayd vnto him, Thou knowest, what seruice I haue done thee, and in what taking thy cattell hath bene vnder me."
"861",861,"Genesis",1,30,30,"For the litle, that thou haddest before I came, is increased into a multitude: and the Lorde hath blessed thee by my coming: but nowe when shall I trauell for mine owne house also?"
"862",862,"Genesis",1,30,31,"Then he saide, What shal I giue thee? And Iaakob answered, Thou shalt giue mee nothing at all: if thou wilt doe this thing for mee, I will returne, feede, and keepe thy sheepe."
"863",863,"Genesis",1,30,32,"I wil passe through all thy flockes this day, and separate from them all the sheepe with litle spots & great spots, and al blacke lambes among the sheepe, and the great spotted, and litle spotted among the goates: and it shalbe my wages."
"864",864,"Genesis",1,30,33,"So shal my righteousnesse answere for me hereafter, when it shall come for my rewarde before thy face, and euery one that hath not litle or great spots among the goates, and blacke among the sheepe, the same shalbe theft with me."
"865",865,"Genesis",1,30,34,"Then Laban sayde, Goe to, woulde God it might be according to thy saying."
"866",866,"Genesis",1,30,35,"Therefore he tooke out the same day the hee goates that were partie coloured and with great spots, and all the shee goates with litle and great spots, and all that had white in them, and all the blacke among the sheepe, and put them in the keeping of his sonnes."
"867",867,"Genesis",1,30,36,"And hee set three dayes iourney betweene himselfe and Iaakob; Iaakob kept the rest of Labans sheepe."
"868",868,"Genesis",1,30,37,"Then Iaakob tooke rods of greene popular, and of hasell, and of the chesnut tree, and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appeare in the rods."
"869",869,"Genesis",1,30,38,"Then he put the rods, which he had pilled, in the gutters and watering troughes, when the sheepe came to drink, before the sheepe. (for they were in heate, when they came to drinke)"
"870",870,"Genesis",1,30,39,"And the sheepe were in heate before the rods, and afterward brought forth yong of partie colour, and with small and great spots."
"871",871,"Genesis",1,30,40,"And Iaakob parted these lambes, and turned the faces of the flocke towardes these lambes partie coloured and all maner of blacke, among the sheepe of Laban: so hee put his owne flockes by themselues, and put them not with Labans flocke."
"872",872,"Genesis",1,30,41,"And in euery ramming time of the stronger sheepe, Iaakob layde the rods before the eyes of the sheepe in the gutters, that they might conceiue before the rods."
"873",873,"Genesis",1,30,42,"But when the sheepe were feeble, hee put them not in: and so the feebler were Labans, and the stronger Iaakobs."
"874",874,"Genesis",1,30,43,"So the man encreased exceedingly, and had many flockes, and maide seruantes, and men seruants, and camels and asses."
"875",875,"Genesis",1,31,1,"Now he heard the words of Labans sonnes, saying, Iaakob hath taken away all that was our fathers, and of our fathers goods hath he gotten all this honour."
"876",876,"Genesis",1,31,2,"Also Iaakob beheld the countenance of Laban, that it was not towards him as in times past:"
"877",877,"Genesis",1,31,3,"And the Lorde had said vnto Iaakob, Turne againe into the lande of thy fathers, and to thy kinred, and I wilbe with thee."
"878",878,"Genesis",1,31,4,"Therefore Iaakob sent and called Rahel and Leah to the fielde vnto his flocke."
"879",879,"Genesis",1,31,5,"Then sayde hee vnto them, I see your fathers countenance, that it is not towardes me as it was wont, and the God of my father hath bene with me."
"880",880,"Genesis",1,31,6,"And yee knowe that I haue serued your father with all my might."
"881",881,"Genesis",1,31,7,"But your father hath deceiued me, & changed my wages tenne times: but God suffred him not to hurt me."
"882",882,"Genesis",1,31,8,"If he thus sayd, The spotted shall be thy wages, then all the sheepe bare spotted: and if he sayd thus, the party coloured shalbe thy rewarde, then bare all the sheepe particoloured."
"883",883,"Genesis",1,31,9,"Thus hath God taken away your fathers substance, and giuen it me."
"884",884,"Genesis",1,31,10,"For in ramming time I lifted vp mine eyes and saw in a dreame, & beholde, ye hee goates leaped vpon the shee goates, that were partie coloured with litle and great spots spotted."
"885",885,"Genesis",1,31,11,"And the Angel of God sayde to mee in a dreame, Iaakob; I answered, Lo, I am here."
"886",886,"Genesis",1,31,12,"And he sayde, Lift vp nowe thine eyes, and see all the hee goates leaping vpon ye shee goates that are partie coloured, spotted with litle and great spots: for I haue seene all that Laban doeth vnto thee."
"887",887,"Genesis",1,31,13,"I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anoyntedst the pillar, where thou vowedst a vowe vnto me. Nowe arise, get thee out of this countrey and returne vnto ye land where thou wast borne."
"888",888,"Genesis",1,31,14,"Then answered Rahel and Leah, and sayde vnto him, Haue wee any more porcion and inheritance in our fathers house?"
"889",889,"Genesis",1,31,15,"Doeth not he count vs as strangers? For he hath solde vs, and hath eaten vp and consumed our money."
"890",890,"Genesis",1,31,16,"Therefore all the riches, which God hath taken from our father, is ours and our childrens: nowe then whatsoeuer God hath saide vnto thee, doe it."
"891",891,"Genesis",1,31,17,"Then Iaakob rose vp, and set his sonnes and his wiues vpon camels."
"892",892,"Genesis",1,31,18,"And he caried away all his flockes, & al his substance which he had gotten, to wit, his riches, which he had gotten in Padan Aram, to goe to Izhak his father vnto the land of Canaan."
"893",893,"Genesis",1,31,19,"Whe Laban was gone to shere his sheepe, Then Rahel stole her fathers idoles."
"894",894,"Genesis",1,31,20,"Thus Iaakob stole away ye heart of Laban the Aramite: for he told him not that he fled."
"895",895,"Genesis",1,31,21,"So fled he with all that he had, and he rose vp, and passed the riuer, and set his face towarde mount Gilead."
"896",896,"Genesis",1,31,22,"And the third day after was it told Laban, that Iaakob fled."
"897",897,"Genesis",1,31,23,"Then he tooke his brethren with him, & followed after him seuen dayes iourney, and ouertooke him at mount Gilead."
"898",898,"Genesis",1,31,24,"And God came to Laban the Aramite in a dreame by night, and sayde vnto him, Take heede that thou speake not to Iaakob ought saue good."
"899",899,"Genesis",1,31,25,"Then Laban ouertooke Iaakob, & Iaakob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban also with his brethren pitched vpon mount Gilead."
"900",900,"Genesis",1,31,26,"Then Laban sayde to Iaakob, What hast thou done? thou hast euen stolen away mine heart and caried away my daughters as though they had bene taken captiues with the sworde."
"901",901,"Genesis",1,31,27,"Wherfore diddest thou flie so secretly and steale away from me, and diddest not tel me, that I might haue sent thee foorth with mirth & with songs, with timbrel and with harpe?"
"902",902,"Genesis",1,31,28,"But thou hast not suffered me to kisse my sonnes and my daughters: nowe thou hast done foolishly in doing so."
"903",903,"Genesis",1,31,29,"I am able to do you euill: but the God of your father spake vnto me yesternight, saying, Take heed that thou speake not to Iaakob ought saue good."
"904",904,"Genesis",1,31,30,"Nowe though thou wentest thy way, because thou greatly longedst after thy fathers house, yet wherefore hast thou stollen my gods?"
"905",905,"Genesis",1,31,31,"Then Iaakob answered, and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, & thought that thou wouldest haue taken thy daughters from me."
"906",906,"Genesis",1,31,32,"But with whome thou findest thy gods, let him not liue. Search thou before our brethre what I haue of thine, & take it to thee, (but Iaakob wist not that Rahel had stolen them)"
"907",907,"Genesis",1,31,33,"Then came Laban into Iaakobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maides tentes, but founde them not. So hee went out of Leahs tent, and entred into Rahels tent."
"908",908,"Genesis",1,31,34,"(Nowe Rahel had taken the idoles, & put them in the camels litter and sate downe vpon them) and Laban searched al the tent, but found them not."
"909",909,"Genesis",1,31,35,"Then said she to her father, My Lord, be not angrie that I cannot rise vp before thee: for the custome of women is vpo me: so he searched, but found not the idoles."
"910",910,"Genesis",1,31,36,"The Iaakob was wroth, and chode with Laban: Iaakob also answered and sayd to Laban, What haue I trespassed? what haue I offended, that thou hast pursued after me?"
"911",911,"Genesis",1,31,37,"Seeing thou hast searched all my stuffe, what hast thou foud of all thine houshold stuffe? put it here before my brethren & thy brethren, that they may iudge betweene vs both."
"912",912,"Genesis",1,31,38,"This twenty yere I haue bin with thee: thine ewes & thy goates haue not cast their yong, and the rammes of thy flocke haue I not eaten."
"913",913,"Genesis",1,31,39,"Whatsoeuer was torne of beasts, I brought it not vnto thee, but made it good my selfe: of mine hand diddest thou require it, were it stollen by day or stollen by night."
"914",914,"Genesis",1,31,40,"I was in the day consumed with heate, and with frost in the night, and my sleepe departed from mine eyes."
"915",915,"Genesis",1,31,41,"Thus haue I bene twentie yeere in thine house, and serued thee fourteene yeeres for thy two daughters, and sixe yeeres for thy sheepe, and thou hast changed my wages tenne times."
"916",916,"Genesis",1,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the feare of Izhak had bene with me, surely thou haddest sent me away nowe emptie: but God behelde my tribulation, & the labour of mine hads, & rebuked thee yester night."
"917",917,"Genesis",1,31,43,"Then Laban answered, and saide vnto Iaakob, These daughters are my daughters, & these sonnes are my sonnes, and these sheepe are my sheepe, and all that thou seest, is mine, and what can I doe this day vnto these my daughters, or to their sonnes which they haue borne?"
"918",918,"Genesis",1,31,44,"Nowe therefore come and let vs make a couenant, I and thou, which may be a witnes betweene me and thee."
"919",919,"Genesis",1,31,45,"Then tooke Iaakob a stone, and set it vp as a pillar:"
"920",920,"Genesis",1,31,46,"And Iaakob sayde vnto his brethren, Gather stones: who brought stones, and made an heape, and they did eate there vpon the heape."
"921",921,"Genesis",1,31,47,"And Laban called it Iegar-sahadutha, and Iaakob called it Galeed."
"922",922,"Genesis",1,31,48,"For Laban sayd, This heape is witnesse betweene me and thee this day: therefore he called the name of it Galeed."
"923",923,"Genesis",1,31,49,"Also he called it Mizpah, because he said, The Lorde looke betweene me and thee, when we shalbe departed one from another,"
"924",924,"Genesis",1,31,50,"If thou shalt vexe my daughters, or shalt take wiues beside my daughters: there is no man with vs, beholde, God is witnesse betweene me and thee."
"925",925,"Genesis",1,31,51,"Moreouer Laban sayd to Iaakob, Beholde this heape, and behold the pillar, which I haue set betweene me and thee,"
"926",926,"Genesis",1,31,52,"This heape shall be witnesse, and the pillar shall be witnesse, that I will not come ouer this heape to thee, and that thou shalt not passe ouer this heape and this pillar vnto me for euill."
"927",927,"Genesis",1,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nabor, and the God of their father be iudge betweene vs: But Iaakob sware by the feare of his father Izhak."
"928",928,"Genesis",1,31,54,"Then Iaakob did offer a sacrifice vpon the mount, and called his brethren to eate bread; they did eate bread, and taried all night in the mount."
"929",929,"Genesis",1,31,55,"And earely in the morning Laban rose vp and kissed his sonnes and his daughters, & blessed them, & Laban departing, went vnto his place againe."

"931",931,"Genesis",1,32,2,"And when Iaakob saw them, he said, This is Gods hoste, and called the name of the same place Mahanaim."
"932",932,"Genesis",1,32,3,"Then Iaakob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, vnto the land of Seir into the countrey of Edom:"

"934",934,"Genesis",1,32,5,"I haue beeues also and Asses, sheepe, & men seruantes, and women seruantes, and haue sent to shew my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
"935",935,"Genesis",1,32,6,"So ye messengers came againe to Iaakob, saying, We came vnto thy brother Esau, and hee also commeth against thee and foure hundreth men with him."
"936",936,"Genesis",1,32,7,"Then Iaakob was greatly afraid, and was sore troubled, and deuided the people that was with him, and the sheepe, and the beeues, and the camels into two companies."
"937",937,"Genesis",1,32,8,"For he said, If Esau come to ye one copanie and smite it, the other companie shall escape."
"938",938,"Genesis",1,32,9,"Moreouer Iaakob said, O God of my father Abraham, & God of my father Izhak: Lord, which saydest vnto me, Returne vnto thy coutrey and to thy kinred, and I will do thee good,"
"939",939,"Genesis",1,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and al the trueth, which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant: for with my staffe came I ouer this Iorden, & now haue I gotte two bads."
"940",940,"Genesis",1,32,11,"I pray thee, Deliuer me from the hande of my brother, from the hande of Esau: for I feare him, least he will come and smite me, and the mother vpon the children."
"941",941,"Genesis",1,32,12,"For thou saydest; I will surely doe thee good, and make thy seede as the sande of the sea, which can not be nombred for multitude."
"942",942,"Genesis",1,32,13,"And he taryed there the same night, and tooke of that which came to had, a present for Esau his brother:"
"943",943,"Genesis",1,32,14,"Two hundreth shee goates & twenty hee goates, two hundreth ewes & twentie rammes:"
"944",944,"Genesis",1,32,15,"Thirtie mylche camels with their coltes, fourtie kine, and ten bullockes, twentie she asses and ten foles."
"945",945,"Genesis",1,32,16,"So he deliuered them into the hande of his seruants, euery droue by themselues, and saide vnto his seruants, Passe before me, & put a space betweene droue and droue."
"946",946,"Genesis",1,32,17,"And he commanded the formost, saying, If Esau my brother meete thee, and aske thee, saying, Whose seruant art thou? And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee?"
"947",947,"Genesis",1,32,18,"Then thou shalt say, They be thy seruant Iaakobs: it is a present sent vnto my lord Esau: and beholde, he him selfe also is behinde vs."
"948",948,"Genesis",1,32,19,"So likewise commaunded he the seconde and the thirde, and all that followed the droues, saying, After this maner, ye shall speake vnto Esau, when ye finde him."
"949",949,"Genesis",1,32,20,"And ye shall say moreouer, Beholde, thy seruant Iaakob commeth after vs (for he thought, I will appease his wrath with the present that goeth before me, and afterwarde I will see his face: it may be that he will accept me.)"
"950",950,"Genesis",1,32,21,"So went the present before him: but he taried that night with the companie."
"951",951,"Genesis",1,32,22,"And he rose vp the same night, and tooke his two wiues, and his two maides, and his eleuen children, and went ouer the forde Iabbok."
"952",952,"Genesis",1,32,23,"And he tooke them, and sent them ouer the riuer, and sent ouer that he had."
"953",953,"Genesis",1,32,24,"Now when Iaakob was left him selfe alone, there wrestled a man with him vnto the breaking of the day."
"954",954,"Genesis",1,32,25,"And he sawe that he could not preuaile against him: therefore he touched the holowe of his thigh, and the holowe of Iaakobs thigh was loosed, as he wrestled with him."
"955",955,"Genesis",1,32,26,"And he saide, Let me goe, for the morning appeareth. Who answered, I will not let thee go except thou blesse me."
"956",956,"Genesis",1,32,27,"Then said he vnto him, What is thy name? And he said, Iaakob."
"957",957,"Genesis",1,32,28,"Then said he, Thy name shalbe called Iaakob no more, but Israel: because thou hast had power with God, thou shalt also preuaile with men."
"958",958,"Genesis",1,32,29,"Then Iaakob demaded, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name; he said, Wherefore now doest thou aske my name? & he blessed him there"
"959",959,"Genesis",1,32,30,"And Iaakob called the name of the place, Peniel: for, saide he, I haue seene God face to face, and my life is preserued."
"960",960,"Genesis",1,32,31,"And the sunne rose vp to him as he passed Peniel, and he halted vpon his thigh."
"961",961,"Genesis",1,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eate not of the sinewe that shranke in the hollowe of the thigh, vnto this day: because he touched the sinew that shranke in the holow of Iaakobs thigh."
"962",962,"Genesis",1,33,1,"And as Iaakob lift vp his eyes, and looked, behold, Esau came, and with him foure hundreth men: and he deuided the children to Leah, and to Rahel, and to the two maides."
"963",963,"Genesis",1,33,2,"And he put the maides, and their children formost, and Leah, and her children after, and Rahel, and Ioseph hindermost."
"964",964,"Genesis",1,33,3,"So he went before them and bowed him selfe to the ground seuen times, vntill he came neere to his brother."
"965",965,"Genesis",1,33,4,"Then Esau ranne to meete him, and embraced him, and fell on his necke, and kissed him, & they wept."
"966",966,"Genesis",1,33,5,"And he lift vp his eyes, and sawe the women, and the children, and saide, Who are these with thee? And he answered, They are ye childre whome God of his grace hath giuen thy seruant."
"967",967,"Genesis",1,33,6,"Then came the maides neere, they, and their children, and bowed themselues."
"968",968,"Genesis",1,33,7,"Leah also with her children came nere and made obeysance: and after Ioseph & Rahel drew neere, and did reuerence."
"969",969,"Genesis",1,33,8,"Then he said, What meanest thou by all this droue, which I met? Who answered, I haue sent it, that I may finde fauour in the sight of my lorde:"
"970",970,"Genesis",1,33,9,"And Esau said, I haue ynough, my brother: keepe that thou hast to thy selfe."
"971",971,"Genesis",1,33,10,"But Iaakob answered, Nay, I pray thee: if I haue found grace nowe in thy sight, then receiue my present at mine hande: for I haue seene thy face, as though I had seene the face of God, because thou hast accepted me."
"972",972,"Genesis",1,33,11,"I pray thee take my blessing, that is brought thee: for God hath had mercie on me, and therefore I haue all things: so he compelled him, and he tooke it."
"973",973,"Genesis",1,33,12,"And he saide, Let vs take our iourney and go, and I will goe before thee."
"974",974,"Genesis",1,33,13,"Then he answered him, My lord knoweth, that the children are tender, & the ewes & kine with yong vnder mine hande: and if they should ouerdriue them one day, all the flocke would die."
"975",975,"Genesis",1,33,14,"Let now my lord go before his seruant, & I will driue softly, according to ye pase of ye cattel, which is before me, and as the children be able to endure, vntill I come to my lord vnto Seir."
"976",976,"Genesis",1,33,15,"Then Esau said, I will leaue then some of my folke with thee; he answered, what needeth this? let me finde grace in the sight of my lorde."
"977",977,"Genesis",1,33,16,"So Esau returned, and went his way that same day vnto Seir."
"978",978,"Genesis",1,33,17,"And Iaakob went forwarde towarde Succoth, and built him an house, & made boothes for his cattell: therefore he called the name of the place Succoth."
"979",979,"Genesis",1,33,18,"Afterward, Iaakob came safe to Sheche a citie, which is in the lande of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram, and pitched before the citie."
"980",980,"Genesis",1,33,19,"And there he bought a parcell of ground, where hee pitched his tent, at the hande of the sonnes of Hamor Shechems father, for an hundreth pieces of money."
"981",981,"Genesis",1,33,20,"And he set vp there an altar, and called it, The mightie God of Israel."
"982",982,"Genesis",1,34,1,"Then Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare vnto Iaakob, went out to see the daughters of that countrey."
"983",983,"Genesis",1,34,2,"Whome when Shechem the sonne of Hamor the Hiuite lorde of that countrey sawe, hee tooke her, and lay with her, and defiled her."

"986",986,"Genesis",1,34,5,"(Nowe Iaakob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sonnes were with his cattell in the fielde: therefore Iaakob helde his peace, vntill they were come.)"
"987",987,"Genesis",1,34,6,"Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out vnto Iaakob to commune with him."
"988",988,"Genesis",1,34,7,"And whe the sonnes of Iaakob were come out of the fielde and heard it, it grieued the men, & they were very angry, because he had wrought villenie in Israel, in that he had lyen with Iaakobs daughter: which thing ought not to be done."
"989",989,"Genesis",1,34,8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, the soule of my sonne Shechem longeth for your daughter: giue her him to wife, I pray you."
"990",990,"Genesis",1,34,9,"So make affinitie with vs: giue your daughters vnto vs, and take our daughters vnto you,"

"993",993,"Genesis",1,34,12,"Aske of me abundantly both dowrie and giftes, and I will giue as ye appoint me, so that ye giue me the maide to wife."
"994",994,"Genesis",1,34,13,"Then the sonnes of Iaakob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, talking deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,"
"995",995,"Genesis",1,34,14,"And they said vnto them, We can not do this thing, to giue our sister to an vncircumcised man: for that were a reproofe vnto vs."
"996",996,"Genesis",1,34,15,"But in this will we consent vnto you, if ye will be as we are, that euery man childe among you be circumcised:"
"997",997,"Genesis",1,34,16,"Then will we giue our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to vs, and will dwell with you, and be one people."
"998",998,"Genesis",1,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken vnto vs to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter and depart."

"1012",1012,"Genesis",1,34,31,"And they answered, Shoulde hee abuse our sister as a whore?"
"1013",1013,"Genesis",1,35,1,"Then God sayde to Iaakob, Arise, goe vp to Beth-el and dwell there, and make there an altar vnto God, that appeared vnto thee, when thou fleddest from Esau thy brother."
"1014",1014,"Genesis",1,35,2,"Then saide Iaakob vnto his houshold and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and clense your selues, and change your garments:"
"1015",1015,"Genesis",1,35,3,"For we will rise and goe vp to Beth-el, and I will make an altar there vnto God, which heard me in the day of my tribulation, and was with me in the way which I went."
"1016",1016,"Genesis",1,35,4,"And they gaue vnto Iaakob all the strange gods, which were in their hands, and all their earings which were in their eares, and Iaakob hidde them vnder an oke, which was by Shechem."

"1135",1135,"Genesis",1,38,15,"When Iudah sawe her, he iudged her an whore: for she had couered her face."
"1136",1136,"Genesis",1,38,16,"And he turned to the way towardes her, and saide, Come, I pray thee, let me lie with thee. (for he knewe not that she was his daughter in lawe) And she answered, What wilt thou giue me for to lie with me?"
"1137",1137,"Genesis",1,38,17,"Then said he, I will sende thee a kid of the goates from the flocke; she said, Well, if thou wilt giue me a pledge, till thou sende it."
"1138",1138,"Genesis",1,38,18,"Then he saide, What is the pledge that I shall giue thee? And she answered, Thy signet, and thy cloke, and thy staffe that is in thine hande. So he gaue it her, and lay by her, and she was with childe by him."
"1139",1139,"Genesis",1,38,19,"Then she rose, and went and put her vaile from her and put on her widowes raiment."
"1140",1140,"Genesis",1,38,20,"Afterwarde Iudah sent a kid of the goates by the hande of his neighbour the Adullamite, for to receiue his pledge from the womans hand: but he found her not."
"1141",1141,"Genesis",1,38,21,"Then asked he the men of that place, saying, Where is ye whore, that sate in Enaim by the way side? And they answered, There was no whore here."
"1142",1142,"Genesis",1,38,22,"He came therefore to Iudah againe, and said, I can not finde her, and also the men of the place said, There was no whore there."
"1143",1143,"Genesis",1,38,23,"Then Iudah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: beholde, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
"1144",1144,"Genesis",1,38,24,"Now after three moneths, one tolde Iudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the whore, and lo, with playing the whore, she is great with childe. Then Iudah saide, Bring ye her foorth and let her be burnt."
"1145",1145,"Genesis",1,38,25,"When she was brought foorth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, vnto whom these things pertaine, am I with childe: and saide also, Looke, I pray thee, whose these are, the seale, and the cloke, and the staffe."
"1146",1146,"Genesis",1,38,26,"Then Iudah knewe them, and said, She is more righteous then I: for she hath done it because I gaue her not to Shelah my sonne. So he lay with her no more."
"1147",1147,"Genesis",1,38,27,"Now, when the time was come that she should be deliuered, beholde, there were twinnes in her wombe."
"1148",1148,"Genesis",1,38,28,"And when she was in trauell, the one put out his hand: and the midwife tooke and bound a red threde about his hand, saying, This is come out first."
"1149",1149,"Genesis",1,38,29,"But when he plucked his hand backe againe, loe, his brother came out, and the midwife said, How hast thou broken the breach vpon thee? and his name was called Pharez."
"1150",1150,"Genesis",1,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother that had the red threde about his hande, and his name was called Zarah."
"1151",1151,"Genesis",1,39,1,"Now Ioseph was brought downe into Egypt: and Potiphar an Eunuche of Pharaohs (and his chiefe stewarde an Egyptian) bought him at the hande of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him thither."
"1152",1152,"Genesis",1,39,2,"And the Lorde was with Ioseph, and he was a man that prospered and was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
"1153",1153,"Genesis",1,39,3,"And his master sawe that the Lorde was with him, and that the Lorde made all that hee did to prosper in his hande."
"1154",1154,"Genesis",1,39,4,"So Ioseph founde fauour in his sight, and serued him: and he made him ruler of his house, and put all that he had in his hand."
"1155",1155,"Genesis",1,39,5,"And from that time that he had made him ruler ouer his house and ouer all that he had, the Lorde blessed the Egyptians house for Iosephs sake: and the blessing of the Lorde was vpon all that he had in the house, and in the fielde."
"1156",1156,"Genesis",1,39,6,"Therefore he left all that he had in Iosephs hand, and tooke accompt of nothing, that was with him, saue onely of the bread, which he did eate; Ioseph was a faire person, and well fauoured."
"1157",1157,"Genesis",1,39,7,"Nowe therefore after these thinges, his masters wife cast her eyes vpon Ioseph, and saide, Lye with me."
"1158",1158,"Genesis",1,39,8,"But he refused and said to his masters wife, Beholde, my master knoweth not what he hath in the house with me, but hath committed all that he hath to mine hande."
"1159",1159,"Genesis",1,39,9,"There is no ma greater in this house then I: neither hath he kept any thing from me, but only thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickednes & so sinne against God?"
"1160",1160,"Genesis",1,39,10,"And albeit she spake to Ioseph day by day, yet he hearkened not vnto her, to lye with her, or to be in her company."
"1161",1161,"Genesis",1,39,11,"Then on a certaine day Ioseph entred into the house, to doe his businesse: and there was no man of the houshold in the house:"
"1162",1162,"Genesis",1,39,12,"Therefore she caught him by his garmet, saying, Sleepe with me: but he left his garment in her hand and fled, and got him out."
"1163",1163,"Genesis",1,39,13,"Nowe when she sawe that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled out,"
"1164",1164,"Genesis",1,39,14,"She called vnto the men of her house, and tolde them, saying, Beholde, he hath brought in an Ebrewe vnto vs to mocke vs: who came in to me for to haue slept with me: but I cryed with a loude voyce."
"1165",1165,"Genesis",1,39,15,"And when he heard that I lift vp my voice and cryed, he left his garment with me, and fled away, and got him out."
"1166",1166,"Genesis",1,39,16,"So she layde vp his garment by her, vntill her lord came home."
"1167",1167,"Genesis",1,39,17,"Then she tolde him according to these words, saying, The Ebrew seruat, which thou hast brought vnto vs, came in to me, to mocke me."
"1168",1168,"Genesis",1,39,18,"But assoone as I lift vp my voyce & cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out."
"1169",1169,"Genesis",1,39,19,"Then when his master heard the wordes of his wife, which she tolde him, saying, After this maner did thy seruant to me, his anger was kindled."
"1170",1170,"Genesis",1,39,20,"And Iosephs master tooke him and put him in prison, in the place, where the kings prisoners lay bounde: and there he was in prison."
"1171",1171,"Genesis",1,39,21,"But the Lorde was with Ioseph, and shewed him mercie, and got him fauour in the sight of the master of the prison."
"1172",1172,"Genesis",1,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Iosephs hande all the prisoners that were in the prison, and whatsoeuer they did there, that did he."
"1173",1173,"Genesis",1,39,23,"And the keeper of the prison looked vnto nothing that was vnder his hande, seeing that the Lord was with him: for whatsoeuer he did, the Lorde made it to prosper."
"1174",1174,"Genesis",1,40,1,"And after these things, the butler of the King of Egypt and his baker offended their lorde the King of Egypt."
"1175",1175,"Genesis",1,40,2,"And Pharaoh was angrie against his two officers, against the chiefe butler, and against the chiefe baker."
"1176",1176,"Genesis",1,40,3,"Therefore he put them in ward in his chiefe stewardes house, in the prison and place where Ioseph was bound."
"1177",1177,"Genesis",1,40,4,"And the chiefe steward gaue Ioseph charge ouer them, and he serued them: and they continued a season in warde."
"1178",1178,"Genesis",1,40,5,"And they both dreamed a dreame, eyther of them his dreame in one night, eche one according to the interpretation of his dreame, both the butler and the baker of the King of Egypt, which were bounde in the prison."
"1179",1179,"Genesis",1,40,6,"And when Ioseph came in vnto them in the morning, and looked vpon them, beholde, they were sad."
"1180",1180,"Genesis",1,40,7,"And he asked Pharaohs officers, that were with him in his masters warde, saying, Wherefore looke ye so sadly to day?"
"1181",1181,"Genesis",1,40,8,"Who answered him, We haue dreamed, eche one a dreame, and there is none to interprete the same. Then Ioseph saide vnto them, Are not interpretations of God? Tell them me nowe."
"1182",1182,"Genesis",1,40,9,"So the chiefe butler tolde his dreame to Ioseph, and said vnto him, In my dreame, behold, a vine was before me,"
"1183",1183,"Genesis",1,40,10,"And in the vine were three branches, and as it budded, her flowre came foorth: and the clusters of grapes waxed ripe."
"1184",1184,"Genesis",1,40,11,"And I had Pharaohs cup in mine hande, and I tooke the grapes, & wrung the into Pharaohs cup, and I gaue the cup into Pharaohs hand."
"1185",1185,"Genesis",1,40,12,"Then Ioseph sayde vnto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three braunches are three dayes."
"1186",1186,"Genesis",1,40,13,"Within three dayes shall Pharaoh lift vp thine head, & restore thee vnto thine office, and thou shalt giue Pharaohs cup into his hand after the olde maner, when thou wast his butler."
"1187",1187,"Genesis",1,40,14,"But haue me in remeberance with thee, when thou art in good case, & shew mercie, I pray thee, vnto me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring me out of this house."
"1188",1188,"Genesis",1,40,15,"For I was stollen away by theft out of the land of the Ebrewes, and here also haue I done nothing, wherefore they should put mee in the dungeon."
"1189",1189,"Genesis",1,40,16,"And when the chiefe baker sawe that the interpretation was good, hee saide vnto Ioseph, Also mee thought in my dreame that I had three white baskets on mine head."
"1190",1190,"Genesis",1,40,17,"And in the vppermost basket there was of all maner baken meates for Pharaoh: and the birdes did eate them out of the basket vpon mine head."
"1191",1191,"Genesis",1,40,18,"Then Ioseph answered, and saide, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three dayes:"
"1192",1192,"Genesis",1,40,19,"Within three dayes shall Pharaoh take thine head from thee, & shal hang thee on a tree, and the birdes shall eate thy flesh from off thee."
"1193",1193,"Genesis",1,40,20,"And so the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday, hee made a feast vnto all his seruants: and hee lifted vp the head of the chiefe butler, and the head of the chiefe baker among his seruants."
"1194",1194,"Genesis",1,40,21,"And he restored the chiefe butler vnto his butlershippe, who gaue the cup into Pharaohs hande,"
"1195",1195,"Genesis",1,40,22,"But he hanged the chiefe baker, as Ioseph had interpreted vnto them."
"1196",1196,"Genesis",1,40,23,"Yet the chiefe butler did not remember Ioseph, but forgate him."
"1197",1197,"Genesis",1,41,1,"And two yeeres after, Pharaoh also dreamed, and beholde, he stoode by a riuer,"
"1198",1198,"Genesis",1,41,2,"And loe, there came out of the riuer seuen goodly kine and fatfleshed, and they fedde in a medowe:"
"1199",1199,"Genesis",1,41,3,"And loe, seuen other kine came vp after the out of the riuer, euill fauoured & leane fleshed, and stoode by the other kine vpon the brinke of the riuer."
"1200",1200,"Genesis",1,41,4,"And the euilfauoured and leane fleshed kine did eate vp the seuen welfauoured and fatte kine: so Pharaoh awoke."
"1201",1201,"Genesis",1,41,5,"Againe he slept, and dreamed the second time: and beholde, seuen eares of corne grewe vpon one stalke, ranke and goodly."
"1202",1202,"Genesis",1,41,6,"And loe, seuen thinne eares, and blasted with the east winde, sprang vp after them:"
"1203",1203,"Genesis",1,41,7,"And the thinne eares deuoured the seuen ranke and full eares. then Pharaoh awaked, and loe, it was a dreame."
"1204",1204,"Genesis",1,41,8,"Nowe when the morning came, his spirit was troubled: therefore he sent and called all the soothsayers of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof, and Pharaoh tolde them his dreames: but none coulde interprete them to Pharaoh."
"1205",1205,"Genesis",1,41,9,"Then spake the chiefe butler vnto Pharaoh, saying, I call to minde my faultes this day."
"1206",1206,"Genesis",1,41,10,"Pharaoh being angrie with his seruantes, put me in ward in the chiefe stewards house, both me and the chiefe baker."
"1207",1207,"Genesis",1,41,11,"Then we dreamed a dreame in one night, both I, and he: we dreamed eche man according to the interpretation of his dreame."
"1208",1208,"Genesis",1,41,12,"And there was with vs a yong man, an Ebrew, seruant vnto the chiefe steward, whome when we told, he declared our dreames to vs, to euery one he declared according to his dreame."
"1209",1209,"Genesis",1,41,13,"And as he declared vnto vs, so it came to passe: for he restored me to mine office, & hanged him."
"1210",1210,"Genesis",1,41,14,"Then sent Pharaoh, and called Ioseph, and they brought him hastily out of prison, and he shaued him, and chaunged his rayment, and came to Pharaoh."
"1211",1211,"Genesis",1,41,15,"Then Pharaoh sayde to Ioseph, I haue dreamed a dreame, and no man can interprete it, and I haue hearde say of thee, that when thou hearest a dreame, thou canst interprete it."
"1212",1212,"Genesis",1,41,16,"And Ioseph answered Pharaoh, saying, Without me God shal answere for the wealth of Pharaoh."
"1213",1213,"Genesis",1,41,17,"And Pharaoh sayde vnto Ioseph, In my dreame, beholde, I stoode by the banke of the riuer:"
"1214",1214,"Genesis",1,41,18,"And lo, there came vp out of the riuer seuen fat fleshed, and welfauoured kine, and they fedde in the medowe."
"1215",1215,"Genesis",1,41,19,"Also loe, seuen other kine came vp after them, poore and very euilfauoured, and leanefleshed: I neuer sawe the like in all the lande of Egypt, for euilfauoured."
"1216",1216,"Genesis",1,41,20,"And the leane and euilfauoured kine did eate vp the first seuen fat kine."
"1217",1217,"Genesis",1,41,21,"And when they had eaten them vp, it could not be knowen that they had eaten them, but they were still as euilfauoured, as they were at the beginning: so did I awake."
"1218",1218,"Genesis",1,41,22,"Moreouer I sawe in my dreame, and beholde, seuen eares sprang out of one stalke, full and faire."
"1219",1219,"Genesis",1,41,23,"And lo, seuen eares, withered, thinne, and blasted with the East winde, sprang vp after them."
"1220",1220,"Genesis",1,41,24,"And the thinne eares deuoured the seuen good eares. Nowe I haue tolde the soothsayers, and none can declare it vnto me."
"1221",1221,"Genesis",1,41,25,"Then Ioseph answered Pharaoh, Both Pharaohs dreames are one. God hath shewed Pharaoh, what he is about to doe."
"1222",1222,"Genesis",1,41,26,"The seuen good kine are seuen yeres, and the seuen good eares are seuen yeeres: this is one dreame."
"1223",1223,"Genesis",1,41,27,"Likewise the seuen thinne and euilfauoured kine, that came out after them, are seuen yeeres: and the seuen emptie eares blasted with the East winde, are seuen yeeres of famine."
"1224",1224,"Genesis",1,41,28,"This is the thing which I haue saide vnto Pharaoh, that God hath shewed vnto Pharaoh, what he is about to doe."
"1225",1225,"Genesis",1,41,29,"Beholde, there come seuen yeeres of great plentie in all the land of Egypt."
"1226",1226,"Genesis",1,41,30,"Againe, there shall arise after them seuen yeeres of famine, so that all the plentie shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land:"
"1227",1227,"Genesis",1,41,31,"Neither shall the plentie bee knowen in the land, by reason of this famine that shall come after: for it shalbe exceeding great."
"1228",1228,"Genesis",1,41,32,"And therefore the dreame was doubled vnto Pharaoh the second time, because the thing is established by God, & God hasteth to performe it."
"1229",1229,"Genesis",1,41,33,"Nowe therefore let Pharaoh prouide for a man of vnderstanding and wisedome, and set him ouer the land of Egypt."
"1230",1230,"Genesis",1,41,34,"Let Pharaoh make and appoynt officers ouer the lande, and take vp the fift part of the land of Egypt in the seuen plenteous yeeres."
"1231",1231,"Genesis",1,41,35,"Also let them gather all the foode of these good yeeres that come, and lay vp corne vnder the hand of Pharaoh for foode, in the cities, and let them keepe it."
"1232",1232,"Genesis",1,41,36,"So the foode shall be for the prouision of the lande, against the seuen yeeres of famine, which shalbe in the lande of Egypt, that the land perish not by famine."
"1233",1233,"Genesis",1,41,37,"And the saying pleased Pharaoh and all his seruants."
"1234",1234,"Genesis",1,41,38,"Then saide Pharaoh vnto his seruants, Can we finde such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God?"
"1235",1235,"Genesis",1,41,39,"The Pharaoh said to Ioseph, For as much as God hath shewed thee all this, there is no man of vnderstanding, or of wisedome like vnto thee."
"1236",1236,"Genesis",1,41,40,"Thou shalt be ouer mine house, & at thy word shall all my people be armed, onely in the kings throne will I be aboue thee."
"1237",1237,"Genesis",1,41,41,"Moreouer Pharaoh said to Ioseph, Behold, I haue set thee ouer all the land of Egypt."
"1238",1238,"Genesis",1,41,42,"And Pharaoh tooke off his ring from his hand, and put it vpon Iosephs hand, and arayed him in garments of fine linnen, and put a golden cheyne about his necke."
"1239",1239,"Genesis",1,41,43,"So he set him vpon the best charet that hee had, saue one: & they cryed before him, Abrech, & placed him ouer all the land of Egypt."
"1240",1240,"Genesis",1,41,44,"Againe Pharaoh saide vnto Ioseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift vp his hand or his foote in all the land of Egypt."
"1241",1241,"Genesis",1,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Iosephs name Zaphnath-paaneah: and he gaue him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On. then went Ioseph abrode in the land of Egypt."
"1242",1242,"Genesis",1,41,46,"And Ioseph was thirtie yeere old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt: and Ioseph departing from the presence of Pharaoh, went throughout all the land of Egypt."
"1243",1243,"Genesis",1,41,47,"And in the seuen plenteous yeres the earth brought foorth store."
"1244",1244,"Genesis",1,41,48,"And hee gathered vp all the foode of the seuen plenteous yeeres, which were in the lande of Egypt, and layde vp foode in the cities: the foode of the fielde, that was round about euery citie, layde he vp in the same."
"1245",1245,"Genesis",1,41,49,"So Ioseph gathered wheate, like vnto the sand of the sea in multitude out of measure, vntill he left numbring: for it was without number."
"1246",1246,"Genesis",1,41,50,"Now vnto Ioseph were borne two sonnes (before the yeeres of famine came) which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On bare vnto him."
"1247",1247,"Genesis",1,41,51,"And Ioseph called the name of the first borne Manasseh: for God, said he, hath made me forget all my labour & al my fathers houshold."
"1248",1248,"Genesis",1,41,52,"Also hee called the name of the second, Ephraim: For God, sayde he hath made me fruitfull in the land of mine affliction."
"1249",1249,"Genesis",1,41,53,"So the seuen yeeres of the plentie that was in the land of Egypt were ended."
"1250",1250,"Genesis",1,41,54,"Then began the seuen yeeres of famine to come, according as Ioseph had saide: and the famine was in all landes, but in all the land of Egypt was bread."
"1251",1251,"Genesis",1,41,55,"At the length all the lande of Egypt was affamished, and the people cryed to Pharaoh for bread; Pharaoh said vnto all the Egyptians, Goe to Ioseph: what he sayth to you, doe ye."
"1252",1252,"Genesis",1,41,56,"When the famine was vpon all the land, Ioseph opened all places, wherein the store was, and solde vnto the Egyptians: for the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt."
"1253",1253,"Genesis",1,41,57,"And all countries came to Egypt to bye corne of Ioseph, because the famine was sore in all landes."
"1254",1254,"Genesis",1,42,1,"Then Iaakob saw that there was foode in Egypt, and Iaakob said vnto his sonnes, Why gaze ye one vpon an other?"
"1255",1255,"Genesis",1,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I haue heard that there is foode in Egypt, Get you downe thither, & bie vs foode thence, that we may liue and not die."
"1256",1256,"Genesis",1,42,3,"So went Iosephs ten brethren downe to bye corne of the Egyptians."
"1257",1257,"Genesis",1,42,4,"But Beniamin Iosephs brother woulde not Iaakob send with his brethren: for he saide, Least death should befall him."
"1258",1258,"Genesis",1,42,5,"And the sonnes of Israel came to bye foode among them that came: for there was famine in the land of Canaan."
"1259",1259,"Genesis",1,42,6,"Now Ioseph was gouerner of the land, who solde to all the people of the lande: then Iosephs brethren came, & bowed their face to the groud before him."
"1260",1260,"Genesis",1,42,7,"And when Ioseph sawe his brethren, hee knewe them, and made himselfe straunge toward them, and spake to them roughly, and saide vnto them, Whence come yee? Who answered, Out of the land of Canaan, to bye vitaile."
"1261",1261,"Genesis",1,42,8,"(Now Ioseph knewe his brethren, but they knew not him."
"1262",1262,"Genesis",1,42,9,"And Ioseph remembred the dreames, which he dreamed of them) and he sayde vnto them, Ye are spies, and are come to see the weaknesse of the land."
"1263",1263,"Genesis",1,42,10,"But they sayde vnto him, Nay, my lorde, but to bye vitayle thy seruants are come."
"1264",1264,"Genesis",1,42,11,"Wee are all one mans sonnes: wee meane truely, and thy seruants are no spies."
"1265",1265,"Genesis",1,42,12,"But he saide vnto them, Nay, but yee are come to see the weakenes of the land."
"1266",1266,"Genesis",1,42,13,"And they said, We thy seruants are twelue brethren, the sonnes of one man in the lande of Canaan: and beholde, the yongest is this day with our father, and one is not."
"1267",1267,"Genesis",1,42,14,"Againe Ioseph sayde vnto them, This is it that I spake vnto you, saying, Ye are spies."
"1268",1268,"Genesis",1,42,15,"Hereby ye shall be proued: by the life of Pharaoh, ye shal not goe hence, except your yongest brother come hither."
"1269",1269,"Genesis",1,42,16,"Send one of you which may fet your brother, & ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proued, whether there bee trueth in you: or els by the life of Pharaoh ye are but spies."
"1270",1270,"Genesis",1,42,17,"So he put them in warde three dayes."
"1271",1271,"Genesis",1,42,18,"Then Ioseph said vnto them the third day, This do, and liue: for I feare God."
"1272",1272,"Genesis",1,42,19,"If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bounde in your prison house, and goe ye, carie foode for the famine of your houses:"
"1273",1273,"Genesis",1,42,20,"But bring your yonger brother vnto me, that your wordes may be tried, and that ye dye not: and they did so."
"1274",1274,"Genesis",1,42,21,"And they said one to another, We haue verily sinned against our brother, in that we sawe the anguish of his soule, when he besought vs, and we would not heare him: therefore is this trouble come vpon vs."
"1275",1275,"Genesis",1,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Warned I not you, saying, Sinne not against the childe, and ye would not heare? and lo, his blood is now required."
"1276",1276,"Genesis",1,42,23,"(And they were not aware that Ioseph vnderstoode them: for he spake vnto them by an interpreter.)"
"1277",1277,"Genesis",1,42,24,"Then he turned from them, and wept, & turned to them againe, & communed with them, and tooke Simeon from among them, & bounde him before their eyes."
"1278",1278,"Genesis",1,42,25,"So Ioseph commanded that they should fill their sackes with wheate, and put euery mans money againe in his sacke, and giue them vitaile for the iourney: and thus did he vnto them."
"1279",1279,"Genesis",1,42,26,"And they layed their vitaile vpon their asses, and departed thence."
"1280",1280,"Genesis",1,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sacke for to giue his asse prouender in the ynne, he espyed his money: for lo, it was in his sackes mouth."
"1281",1281,"Genesis",1,42,28,"Then he sayde vnto his brethren, My money is restored: for loe, it is euen in my sacke; their heart fayled them, and they were astonished, and sayde one to another, What is this, that God hath done vnto vs?"
"1282",1282,"Genesis",1,42,29,"And they came vnto Iaakob their father vnto the lande of Canaan, and tolde him all that had befallen them, saying,"
"1283",1283,"Genesis",1,42,30,"The man, who is Lorde of the lande, spake roughly to vs, and put vs in prison as spyes of the countrey."
"1284",1284,"Genesis",1,42,31,"And we sayd vnto him, We are true men, and are no spies."
"1285",1285,"Genesis",1,42,32,"We be twelue brethren, sonnes of our father: one is not, and the yongest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
"1286",1286,"Genesis",1,42,33,"Then the Lord of the countrey sayde vnto vs, Hereby shal I knowe if ye be true men: Leaue one of your brethren with me, and take foode for the famine of your houses and depart,"
"1287",1287,"Genesis",1,42,34,"And bring your yongest brother vnto me, that I may knowe that ye are no spies, but true men: so will I deliuer you your brother, and yee shall occupie in the land."
"1288",1288,"Genesis",1,42,35,"And as they emptied their sacks, behold, euery mans bundel of money was in his sacke: and when they and their father sawe the bundels of their money, they were afrayde."
"1289",1289,"Genesis",1,42,36,"Then Iaakob their father said to them, Ye haue robbed me of my children: Ioseph is not, & Simeon is not, and ye will take Beniamin: all these things are against me."
"1290",1290,"Genesis",1,42,37,"Then Reuben answered his father, saying, Slay my two sonnes, if I bring him not to thee againe: deliuer him to mine hand, and I will bring him to thee againe."
"1291",1291,"Genesis",1,42,38,"But he sayd, My sonne shall not go downe with you: for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if death come vnto him by the way which ye goe, then ye shall bring my gray head with sorow vnto the graue."
"1292",1292,"Genesis",1,43,1,"Now great famine was in the land."
"1293",1293,"Genesis",1,43,2,"And when they had eaten vp the vitaile, which they had brought from Egypt, their father sayd vnto them, Turne againe, and bye vs a little foode."
"1294",1294,"Genesis",1,43,3,"And Iudah answered him, saying, The man charged vs by an othe, saying, Neuer see my face, except your brother be with you."
"1295",1295,"Genesis",1,43,4,"If thou wilt sende our brother with vs, we will goe downe, and bye thee foode:"
"1296",1296,"Genesis",1,43,5,"But if thou wilt not send him, we wil not go downe: for the man said vnto vs, Looke me not in the face, except your brother be with you."
"1297",1297,"Genesis",1,43,6,"And Israel sayd, Wherefore delt ye so euill with me, as to tell the man, whether ye had yet a brother or no?"
"1298",1298,"Genesis",1,43,7,"And they answered, The man asked straitly of our selues and of our kinred, saying, Is your father yet aliue? haue ye any brother? And wee tolde him according to these wordes: could we knowe certainely that he would say, Bring your brother downe?"
"1299",1299,"Genesis",1,43,8,"Then sayde Iudah to Israel his father, Send the boy with mee, that we may rise and goe, and that we may liue and not dye, both we, and thou, and our children."
"1300",1300,"Genesis",1,43,9,"I wil be suertie for him: of mine hand shalt thou require him. If I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me beare the blame for euer."
"1301",1301,"Genesis",1,43,10,"For except we had made this tarying, doutlesse by this we had returned the second time."
"1302",1302,"Genesis",1,43,11,"Then their father Israel sayd vnto them, If it must needes be so now, do thus: take of the best fruites of the lande in your vessels, and bring the man a present, a little rosen, & a little hony, spices and myrrhe, nuttes, and almondes:"
"1303",1303,"Genesis",1,43,12,"And take double money in your hande, and the money, that was brought againe in your sackes mouthes: cary it againe in your hand, lest it were some ouersight."
"1304",1304,"Genesis",1,43,13,"Take also your brother and arise, and go againe to the man."
"1305",1305,"Genesis",1,43,14,"And God almightie giue you mercie in the sight of the man, that hee may deliuer you your other brother, and Beniamin: but I shall be robbed of my childe, as I haue bene."
"1306",1306,"Genesis",1,43,15,"Thus the men tooke this present, & tooke twise so much money in their hande with Beniamin, and rose vp, and went downe to Egypt and stoode before Ioseph."
"1307",1307,"Genesis",1,43,16,"And whe Ioseph saw Beniamin with them, he sayde to his stewarde, Bring these men home and kill meate, and make ready: for the men shal eate with me at noone."
"1308",1308,"Genesis",1,43,17,"And the man did as Ioseph bad, & brought the men vnto Iosephs house."
"1309",1309,"Genesis",1,43,18,"Nowe when the men were brought into Iosephs house, they were afrayd, & sayd, Because of the money, that came in our sackes mouthes at the first time, are we brought, that hee may picke a quarrell against vs, and lay some thing to our charge, and bring vs in bondage and our asses."
"1310",1310,"Genesis",1,43,19,"Therefore came they to Iosephs stewarde, & communed with him at the doore of ye house."
"1311",1311,"Genesis",1,43,20,"And said, Oh syr, we came in deede down hither at the first time to bye foode,"
"1312",1312,"Genesis",1,43,21,"And as wee came to an ynne and opened our sackes, behold, euery mans money was in his sackes mouth, euen our money in full weight, but we haue brought it againe in our handes."
"1313",1313,"Genesis",1,43,22,"Also other money haue we brought in our handes to bye foode, but we cannot tell, who put our money in our sackes."
"1314",1314,"Genesis",1,43,23,"And he said, Peace be vnto you, feare not: your God and the God of your father hath giuen you that treasure in your sackes, I had your money: and he brought forth Simeon to them."
"1315",1315,"Genesis",1,43,24,"So the man led them into Iosephs house, & gaue them water to wash their feete, and gaue their asses prouender."
"1316",1316,"Genesis",1,43,25,"And they made ready their present against Ioseph came at noone, (for they heard say, that they should eate bread there)"
"1317",1317,"Genesis",1,43,26,"When Ioseph came home, they brought the present into the house to him, which was in their handes, and bowed downe to the grounde before him."
"1318",1318,"Genesis",1,43,27,"And he asked them of their prosperitie, and sayd, Is your father the olde man, of whome ye tolde me, in good health? is he yet aliue?"
"1319",1319,"Genesis",1,43,28,"Who answered, Thy seruant our father is in good health, he is yet aliue: and they bowed downe, and made obeysance."
"1320",1320,"Genesis",1,43,29,"And he lifting vp his eyes, beheld his brother Beniamin his mothers sonne, and sayde, Is this your yonger brother, of whome ye tolde me? And he said, God be merciful vnto thee, my sone."
"1321",1321,"Genesis",1,43,30,"And Ioseph made haste (for his affection was inflamed towarde his brother, and sought where to weepe) and entred into his chamber, and wept there."
"1322",1322,"Genesis",1,43,31,"Afterward he washed his face, & came out, and refrained himselfe, and sayd, Set on meate."
"1323",1323,"Genesis",1,43,32,"And they prepared for him by himselfe, and for them by themselues, and for the Egyptians, which did eate with him, by themselues, because the Egyptians might not eate bread with the Ebrewes: for that was an abomination vnto the Egyptians."
"1324",1324,"Genesis",1,43,33,"So they sate before him: the eldest according vnto his age, and the yongest according vnto his youth; the men marueiled among themselues."
"1325",1325,"Genesis",1,43,34,"And they tooke meases from before him, and sent to them: but Beniamins mease was fiue times so much as any of theirs: and they drunke, and had of the best drinke with him."
"1326",1326,"Genesis",1,44,1,"Afterward he commanded his steward, saying, Fill the mens sackes with foode, as much as they can carry, and put euery mans money in his sackes mouth."
"1327",1327,"Genesis",1,44,2,"And put my cup, I meane the siluer cup, in the sackes mouth of the yongest, and his corne money; he did according to the commandement that Ioseph gaue him."
"1328",1328,"Genesis",1,44,3,"And in the morning the men were sent away, they, and their asses."
"1329",1329,"Genesis",1,44,4,"And when they went out of the citie not farre off, Ioseph sayd to his stewarde, Vp, followe after the men: and when thou doest ouertake them, say vnto them, Wherefore haue ye rewarded euill for good?"
"1330",1330,"Genesis",1,44,5,"Is that not the cuppe, wherein my Lorde drinketh? and in the which he doeth deuine and prophecie? ye haue done euill in so doing."
"1331",1331,"Genesis",1,44,6,"And when he ouertooke them, he sayde those wordes vnto them."
"1332",1332,"Genesis",1,44,7,"And they answered him, Wherefore sayeth my lorde such wordes? God forbid that thy seruants should do such a thing."

"1748",1748,"Exodus",2,9,5,"And the Lord appointed a time, saying, To morowe the Lorde shall finish this thing in this lande."
"1749",1749,"Exodus",2,9,6,"So the Lord did this thing on the morow, and all the cattel of Egypt dyed: but of the cattell of the children of Israel dyed not one."
"1750",1750,"Exodus",2,9,7,"Then Pharaoh sent, and beholde, there was not one of the cattell of the Israelites dead: and the heart of Pharaoh was obstinate, and hee did not let the people goe."
"1751",1751,"Exodus",2,9,8,"And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, Take your handfull of ashes of the fornace, and Moses shall sprinkle them towarde the heauen in the sight of Pharaoh,"
"1752",1752,"Exodus",2,9,9,"And they shall be turned to dust in all the land of Egypt: and it shalbe as a scab breaking out into blisters vpon man, and vpon beast, thorow out all the land of Egypt."
"1753",1753,"Exodus",2,9,10,"Then they tooke ashes of the fornace, and stoode before Pharaoh: and Moses sprinkled them towarde the heauen, and there came a scab breaking out into blisters vpon man, and vpon beast."
"1754",1754,"Exodus",2,9,11,"And the sorcerers could not stande before Moses, because of the scab: for the scab was vpon the enchanters, and vpon all the Egyptians."
"1755",1755,"Exodus",2,9,12,"And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not vnto them, as the Lorde had said vnto Moses."
"1756",1756,"Exodus",2,9,13,"Also the Lorde said vnto Moses, Rise vp early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lorde God of the Ebrewes, Let my people goe, that they may serue me."
"1757",1757,"Exodus",2,9,14,"For I will at this time send all my plagues vpon thine heart, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people, that thou mayest knowe that there is none like me in all the earth."
"1758",1758,"Exodus",2,9,15,"For nowe I will stretch out mine hande, that I may smite thee and thy people with the pestilence: and thou shalt perish from the earth."
"1759",1759,"Exodus",2,9,16,"And in deede, for this cause haue I appointed thee, to shewe my power in thee, and to declare my Name throughout all the world."
"1760",1760,"Exodus",2,9,17,"Yet thou exaltest thy selfe against my people, and lettest them not goe."
"1761",1761,"Exodus",2,9,18,"Beholde, to morowe this time I will cause to raine a mightie great haile, such as was not in Egypt since the foundation thereof was laid vnto this time."
"1762",1762,"Exodus",2,9,19,"Send therefore nowe, and gather the cattell, and all that thou hast in the fielde: for vpon all the men, and the beastes, which are found in the field, and not brought home, the haile shal fall vpon them, and they shall die."
"1763",1763,"Exodus",2,9,20,"Such then as feared the word of the Lorde among the seruants of Pharaoh, made his seruants and his cattell flee into the houses:"
"1764",1764,"Exodus",2,9,21,"But such as regarded not the worde of the Lorde, left his seruants, and his cattell in the fielde."
"1765",1765,"Exodus",2,9,22,"And the Lorde saide to Moses, Stretche foorth thine hande towarde heauen, that there may be haile in all the land of Egypt, vpon man, and vpon beast, and vpon all the herbes of the fielde in the lande of Egypt."
"1766",1766,"Exodus",2,9,23,"Then Moses stretched out his rod towarde heauen, & the Lord sent thunder and haile, and lightening vpon the ground: and the Lorde caused haile to raine vpon the land of Egypt."
"1767",1767,"Exodus",2,9,24,"So there was haile, and fire mingled with the haile, so grieuous, as there was none throughout all the lande of Egypt, since it was a nation."
"1768",1768,"Exodus",2,9,25,"And the haile smote throughout al ye land of Egypt all that was in the fielde, both man and beast: also ye haile smote all the herbes of ye field, and brake to pieces all the trees of the fielde."
"1769",1769,"Exodus",2,9,26,"Onely in the lande of Goshen (where the children of Israel were) was no haile."
"1770",1770,"Exodus",2,9,27,"Then Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said vnto them, I haue now sinned: the Lorde is righteous, but I and my people are wicked."
"1771",1771,"Exodus",2,9,28,"Pray ye vnto the Lorde (for it is ynough) that there be no more mightie thunders and haile, and I will let you goe, and yee shall tarie no longer."
"1772",1772,"Exodus",2,9,29,"Then Moses saide vnto him, Assoone as I am out of the citie, I will spreade mine hands vnto the Lorde, and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more haile, that thou mayest knowe that the earth is the Lordes."
"1773",1773,"Exodus",2,9,30,"As for thee and thy seruants, I knowe afore I pray ye will feare before the face of the Lorde God."
"1774",1774,"Exodus",2,9,31,"(And the flaxe, & the barley were smitten: for the barley was eared, & the flaxe was bolled."
"1775",1775,"Exodus",2,9,32,"But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were hid in the grounde)"
"1776",1776,"Exodus",2,9,33,"Then Moses went out of the citie from Pharaoh, and spred his hands to the Lorde, and the thunder and the haile ceased, neither rained it vpon the earth."
"1777",1777,"Exodus",2,9,34,"And when Pharaoh sawe that the raine and the haile and the thunder were ceased, hee sinned againe, and hardened his heart, both he, and his seruants."
"1778",1778,"Exodus",2,9,35,"So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened: neither would he let the children of Israel goe, as the Lord had said by Moses."
"1779",1779,"Exodus",2,10,1,"Againe the Lorde saide vnto Moses, Goe to Pharaoh: for I haue hardened his heart, and the heart of his seruants, that I might worke these my miracles in the middes of his realme,"
"1780",1780,"Exodus",2,10,2,"And that thou maist declare in the eares of thy sonne, & of thy sonnes sonne, what things I haue done in Egypt, and my miracles, which I haue done among them: that ye may knowe that I am the Lorde."
"1781",1781,"Exodus",2,10,3,"Then came Moses and Aaron vnto Pharaoh, and they said vnto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Ebrewes, Howe long wilt thou refuse to humble thy selfe before me? Let my people goe, that they may serue me."
"1782",1782,"Exodus",2,10,4,"But if thou refuse to let my people go, beholde, to morowe will I bring grashoppers into thy coastes."
"1783",1783,"Exodus",2,10,5,"And they shall couer the face of the earth, that a man can not see the earth: and they shall eate the residue which remaineth vnto you, and hath escaped from the haile: and they shall eate all your trees that bud in the fielde."
"1784",1784,"Exodus",2,10,6,"And they shall fil thine houses, and all thy seruants houses, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers fathers haue seene, since the time they were vpon the earth vnto this day. So he returned, and went out from Pharaoh."
"1785",1785,"Exodus",2,10,7,"Then Pharaohs seruants saide vnto him, How long shall he be an offence vnto vs? let the men go, that they may serue the Lord their God: wilt thou first knowe that Egypt is destroyed?"
"1786",1786,"Exodus",2,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought againe vnto Pharaoh, and he saide vnto them, Goe, serue the Lorde your God, but who are they that shall goe?"
"1787",1787,"Exodus",2,10,9,"And Moses answered, We will go with our yong and with our olde, with our sonnes and with our daughters, with our sheepe and with our cattell will we goe: for we must celebrate a feast vnto the Lorde."
"1788",1788,"Exodus",2,10,10,"And he said vnto them, Let the Lorde so be with you, as I will let you goe and your children: beholde, for euill is before your face."
"1789",1789,"Exodus",2,10,11,"It shall not be so: nowe goe ye that are men, and serue the Lorde: for that was your desire. Then they were thrust out from Pharaohs presence."
"1790",1790,"Exodus",2,10,12,"After, the Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hande vpon the lande of Egypt for the grashoppers, that they may come vpon the lande of Egypt, and eate all the herbes of the land, euen all that the haile hath left."
"1791",1791,"Exodus",2,10,13,"Then Moses stretched foorth his rod vpon the lande of Egypt: and the Lorde brought an East winde vpon the land all that day, and al that night: and in the morning the East wind brought the grashoppers."
"1792",1792,"Exodus",2,10,14,"So the grashoppers went vp vpon all the land of Egypt, and remained in all quarters of Egypt: so grieuous Grashoppers, like to these were neuer before, neither after them shalbe such."
"1793",1793,"Exodus",2,10,15,"For they couered all the face of the earth, so that the lande was darke: and they did eate all the herbes of the lande, and all the fruites of the trees, which the haile had left, so that there was no greene thing left vpon the trees, nor among the herbes of the fielde throughout all the lande of Egypt."
"1794",1794,"Exodus",2,10,16,"Therefore Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and sayde, I haue sinned against the Lorde your God, and against you."
"1795",1795,"Exodus",2,10,17,"And nowe forgiue mee my sinne onely this once, and pray vnto the Lord your God, that hee may take away from me this death onely."
"1796",1796,"Exodus",2,10,18,"Moses then went out from Pharaoh, and prayed vnto the Lord."
"1797",1797,"Exodus",2,10,19,"And the Lorde turned a mightie strong West winde, and tooke away the grashoppers, & violently cast them into the red Sea, so that there remained not one grashopper in all the coast of Egypt."
"1798",1798,"Exodus",2,10,20,"But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, & hee did not let the children of Israel goe."
"1799",1799,"Exodus",2,10,21,"Againe ye Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heauen, that there may be vpon the lande of Egypt darkenesse, euen darkenesse that may be felt."
"1800",1800,"Exodus",2,10,22,"Then Moses stretched forth his hande towarde heauen, and there was a blacke darkenesse in all the land of Egypt three daies."
"1801",1801,"Exodus",2,10,23,"No man saw an other, neither rose vp from ye place where he was for three dayes: but all the children of Israel had light where they dwelt."
"1802",1802,"Exodus",2,10,24,"The Pharaoh called for Moses & said, Go, serue the Lord: onely your sheepe and your cattel shall abide, and your children shall go with you."
"1803",1803,"Exodus",2,10,25,"And Moses sayd, Thou must giue vs also sacrifices, and burnt offrings that wee may doe sacrifice vnto the Lord our God."
"1804",1804,"Exodus",2,10,26,"Therefore our cattell also shall go with vs: there shall not an hoofe bee left, for thereof must we take to serue the Lord our God: neither doe wee knowe howe we shall serue the Lorde, vntill we come thither."
"1805",1805,"Exodus",2,10,27,"(But the Lorde hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them goe)"
"1806",1806,"Exodus",2,10,28,"And Pharaoh sayde vnto him, Get thee from mee: looke thou see my face no more: for whensoeuer thou commest in my sight, thou shalt dye."
"1807",1807,"Exodus",2,10,29,"Then Moses said, Thou hast said wel: from henceforth will I see thy face no more."
"1808",1808,"Exodus",2,11,1,"(Now the Lord had saide vnto Moses, yet will I bring one plague more vpo Pharaoh, and vpon Egypt: after that, he will let you go hence: when he letteth you goe, he shall at once chase you hence."
"1809",1809,"Exodus",2,11,2,"Speake thou nowe to the people, that euery man require of his neighbour, & euery woman of her neighbour iewels of siluer & iewels of gold."
"1810",1810,"Exodus",2,11,3,"And the Lorde gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: also Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaohs seruantes, and in the sight of the people.)"
"1811",1811,"Exodus",2,11,4,"Also Moses sayde, Thus sayth the Lord, About midnight will I goe out into the middes of Egypt."
"1812",1812,"Exodus",2,11,5,"And all the first borne in the lande of Egypt shall die, from the first borne of Pharaoh that sitteth on his throne, vnto the first borne of the maide seruant, that is at the mille, and all the first borne of beastes."
"1813",1813,"Exodus",2,11,6,"Then there shalbe a great crie throughout all the land of Egypt, such as was neuer none like, nor shalbe."
"1814",1814,"Exodus",2,11,7,"But against none of ye children of Israel shal a dogge moue his tongue, neyther against man nor beast, that ye may knowe that the Lord putteth a differece betweene the Egyptians & Israel."
"1815",1815,"Exodus",2,11,8,"And all these thy seruants shall come downe vnto me, and fal before me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that are at thy feete, and after this will I depart. So he went out from Pharaoh very angry."
"1816",1816,"Exodus",2,11,9,"And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Pharaoh shall not heare you, that my wonders may bee multiplied in the land of Egypt."
"1817",1817,"Exodus",2,11,10,"So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: but the Lorde hardened Pharaohs heart, and he suffred not the children of Israel to goe out of his lande."
"1818",1818,"Exodus",2,12,1,"Then the Lord spake to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
"1819",1819,"Exodus",2,12,2,"This moneth shalbe vnto you the beginning of moneths: it shalbe to you the first moneth of the yere."
"1820",1820,"Exodus",2,12,3,"Speake ye vnto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this moneth let euery man take vnto him a lambe, according to the house of the fathers, a lambe for an house."
"1821",1821,"Exodus",2,12,4,"And if the housholde be too litle for the lambe, he shall take his neighbour, which is next vnto his house, according to the nomber of the persons: euery one of you, according to his eating shall make your count for the lambes,"
"1822",1822,"Exodus",2,12,5,"Your lambe shalbe without blemish, a male of a yeere olde: ye shall take it of the lambes, or of the kiddes."

"1824",1824,"Exodus",2,12,7,"After, they shall take of the blood, & strike it on the two postes, and on the vpper doore post of the houses where they shall eate it."
"1825",1825,"Exodus",2,12,8,"And they shal eate the flesh the same night, roste with fire, and vnleauened bread: with sowre herbes they shall eate it."
"1826",1826,"Exodus",2,12,9,"Eate not thereof rawe, boyled nor sodden in water, but rost with fire, both his head, his feete, and his purtenance."
"1827",1827,"Exodus",2,12,10,"And ye shal reserue nothing of it vnto the morning: but that, which remaineth of it vnto the morowe, shall ye burne with fire."
"1828",1828,"Exodus",2,12,11,"And thus shall yee eate it, Your loynes girded, your shoes on your feete, and your staues in your handes, and yee shall eate it in haste: for it is the Lords Passeouer."
"1829",1829,"Exodus",2,12,12,"For I will passe through the lande of Egypt the same night, and will smite all the first borne in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and I will execute iudgement vpon all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord."
"1830",1830,"Exodus",2,12,13,"And the blood shalbe a toke for you vpon the houses where ye are: so when I see the blood, I will passe ouer you, and the plague shall not be vpon you to destruction, when I smite the lande of Egypt."

"1832",1832,"Exodus",2,12,15,"Seuen daies shall ye eat vnleauened bread, and in any case ye shall put away leauen the first day out of your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread from the first daie vntill the seuenth day, that person shalbe cut off from Israel."
"1833",1833,"Exodus",2,12,16,"And in the first day shalbe an holie assemblie: also in the seuenth day shalbe an holy assemblie vnto you: no worke shalbe done in them, saue about that which euery man must eate: that onely may ye do."
"1834",1834,"Exodus",2,12,17,"Ye shall keepe also the feast of vnleauened bread: for that same daye I will bring your armies out of the lande of Egypt: therefore ye shal obserue this day, throughout your posteritie, by an ordinance for euer."
"1835",1835,"Exodus",2,12,18,"In the first moneth and the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen, yee shall eate vnleauened bread vnto the one and twentieth day of the moneth at euen."

"1837",1837,"Exodus",2,12,20,"Ye shall eate no leauened bread: but in all your habitations shall ye eate vnleauened bread."
"1838",1838,"Exodus",2,12,21,"Then Moses called all the Elders of Israel, and saide vnto them, Choose out and take you for euerie of your housholdes a lambe, & kill the Passeouer."
"1839",1839,"Exodus",2,12,22,"And take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basen, and strike the lintell, and the doore cheekes with the blood that is in the basen, and let none of you goe out at the doore of his house, vntill the morning."
"1840",1840,"Exodus",2,12,23,"For the Lord will passe by to smite the Egyptians: and when he seeth the blood vpon the lintel and on the two doore cheekes, the Lorde wil passe ouer the doore, & wil not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to plague you."
"1841",1841,"Exodus",2,12,24,"Therefore shall ye obserue this thing as an ordinance both for thee and thy sonnes for euer."
"1842",1842,"Exodus",2,12,25,"And when ye shall come into the land, which the Lord will giue you as hee hath promised, then ye shall keepe this seruice."
"1843",1843,"Exodus",2,12,26,"And when your children aske you, What seruice is this ye keepe?"
"1844",1844,"Exodus",2,12,27,"Then ye shall saye, It is the sacrifice of the Lordes Passeouer, which passed ouer the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and preserued our houses. Then the people bowed them selues, & worshipped."
"1845",1845,"Exodus",2,12,28,"So the children of Israel went, and did as the Lorde had commanded Moses and Aaron: so did they."
"1846",1846,"Exodus",2,12,29,"Nowe at midnight, the Lorde smote all the first borne in the lande of Egypt, from the first borne of Pharaoh that sate on his throne, vnto the first borne of the captiue that was in prison, and all the first borne of beastes."
"1847",1847,"Exodus",2,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose vp in the night, he, and all his seruants and all the Egyptians: and there was a great crye in Egypt: for there was no house where there was not one dead."
"1848",1848,"Exodus",2,12,31,"And hee called to Moses and to Aaron by night, and saide, Rise vp, get you out from among my people, both yee, and the children of Israel, and goe serue the Lorde as ye haue sayde."
"1849",1849,"Exodus",2,12,32,"Take also your sheepe and your cattell as yee haue sayde, & depart, and blesse me also."
"1850",1850,"Exodus",2,12,33,"And the Egyptians did force the people, because they would send them out of the land in haste: for they said, We die all."
"1851",1851,"Exodus",2,12,34,"Therfore the people tooke their dough before it was leauened, euen their dough bound in clothes vpon their shoulders."
"1852",1852,"Exodus",2,12,35,"And the children of Israel did according to the saying of Moses, & they asked of ye Egyptians iewels of siluer & iewels of gold, & raiment."
"1853",1853,"Exodus",2,12,36,"And the Lorde gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: and they graunted their request: so they spoyled the Egyptians."
"1854",1854,"Exodus",2,12,37,"Then the children of Israel tooke their iourney from Rameses to Succoth about sixe hundreth thousand men of foote, beside children."
"1855",1855,"Exodus",2,12,38,"And a great multitude of sundrie sortes of people went out with them, and sheepe, and beeues, and cattel in great abundance."
"1856",1856,"Exodus",2,12,39,"And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt, & made vnleauened cakes: for it was not leauened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, neither coulde they tarie, nor yet prepare themselues vitailes."
"1857",1857,"Exodus",2,12,40,"So the dwelling of the children of Israel, while they dwelled in Egypt, was foure hundreth and thirtie yeres."
"1858",1858,"Exodus",2,12,41,"And when the foure hundreth & thirtie yeeres were expired, euen the selfe same day departed all the hostes of the Lord out of the land of Egypt."
"1859",1859,"Exodus",2,12,42,"It is a night to be kept holie to the Lord, because he brought them out of the lande of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord, which all the children of Israel must keepe throughout their generations."
"1860",1860,"Exodus",2,12,43,"Also the Lorde said vnto Moses & Aaron, This is the Lawe of the Passeouer: no stranger shall eate thereof."
"1861",1861,"Exodus",2,12,44,"But euerie seruant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof."
"1862",1862,"Exodus",2,12,45,"A stranger or an hyred seruant shall not eat thereof."
"1863",1863,"Exodus",2,12,46,"In one house shall it bee eaten: thou shalt carie none of ye flesh out of the house, neither shall ye breake a bone thereof."
"1864",1864,"Exodus",2,12,47,"All the Congregation of Israel shall obserue it."
"1865",1865,"Exodus",2,12,48,"But if a stranger dwell with thee, and will obserue the Passeouer of the Lorde, let him circumcise all the males, that belong vnto him, and then let him come and obserue it, & he shall be as one that is borne in the land: for none vncircumcised person shall eate thereof."
"1866",1866,"Exodus",2,12,49,"One lawe shalbe to him that is borne in the land, and to the stranger that dwelleth among you."
"1867",1867,"Exodus",2,12,50,"Then all the children of Israel did as the Lorde commaunded Moses and Aaron: so did they."
"1868",1868,"Exodus",2,12,51,"And the selfe same day did the Lord bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies."
"1869",1869,"Exodus",2,13,1,"And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"1870",1870,"Exodus",2,13,2,"Sanctifie vnto me all the first borne: that is, euery one that first openeth the wombe among the children of Israel, as well of man as of beast: for it is mine."
"1871",1871,"Exodus",2,13,3,"Then Moses sayd vnto the people, Remember this day in the which ye came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: for by a mightie hande the Lorde brought you out from thence: therefore no leauened bread shall bee eaten."

"1873",1873,"Exodus",2,13,5,"Now when the Lord hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanites, and Hittites, and Amorites, and Hiuites, and Iebusites (which he sware vnto thy fathers, that he woulde giue thee, a land flowing with milke and honie) then thou shalt keepe this seruice in this moneth."
"1874",1874,"Exodus",2,13,6,"Seuen dayes shalt thou eate vnleauened bread, and the seuenth day shall be the feast of the Lord."
"1875",1875,"Exodus",2,13,7,"Vnleauened bread shall bee eaten seuen dayes, and there shal no leauened bread be seene with thee, nor yet leauen be seene with thee in all thy quarters."
"1876",1876,"Exodus",2,13,8,"And thou shalt shew thy sonne in that day, saying, This is done, because of that which the Lord did vnto me, when I came out of Egypt."
"1877",1877,"Exodus",2,13,9,"And it shalbe a signe vnto thee vpo thine hande, and for a remembrance betweene thine eyes, that the Lawe of the Lorde may be in thy mouth: for by a strong hand the Lorde brought thee out of Egypt."
"1878",1878,"Exodus",2,13,10,"Keepe therefore this ordinance in his season appoynted from yeere to yeere."
"1879",1879,"Exodus",2,13,11,"And when the Lord shall bring thee into the lande of the Canaanites, as hee sware vnto thee and to thy fathers, and shall giue it thee,"
"1880",1880,"Exodus",2,13,12,"Then thou shalt set apart vnto the Lorde all that first openeth the wombe: also euery thing that first doeth open the wombe, and commeth forth of thy beast: the males shalbe the Lordes."
"1881",1881,"Exodus",2,13,13,"But euery first foale of an asse, thou shalt redeeme with a lambe: and if thou redeeme him not, then thou shalt breake his necke: likewise all the first borne of man among thy sonnes shalt thou bye out."

"2443",2443,"Exodus",2,32,4,"Who receiued them at their handes, and facioned it with the grauing toole, & made of it a molte calfe: then they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of ye lad of Egypt"
"2444",2444,"Exodus",2,32,5,"When Aaron sawe that, he made an Altar before it: and Aaron proclaimed, saying, To morow shalbe the holy day of the Lord."
"2445",2445,"Exodus",2,32,6,"So they rose vp the next day in the morning, and offred burnt offerings, & brought peace offrings: also the people sate them downe to eate and drinke, and rose vp to play."
"2446",2446,"Exodus",2,32,7,"Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Go, get thee downe: for thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, hath corrupted their wayes."
"2447",2447,"Exodus",2,32,8,"They are soone turned out of the way, which I commanded them: for they haue made them a molten calfe and haue worshipped it, and haue offered thereto, saying, These be thy gods, O Israel, which haue brought thee out of the lande of Egypt."
"2448",2448,"Exodus",2,32,9,"Againe the Lord said vnto Moses, I haue seene this people, and beholde, it is a stiffe necked people."
"2449",2449,"Exodus",2,32,10,"Nowe therefore let mee alone, that my wrath may waxe hote against them, for I wil consume the: but I wil make of thee a mighty people."
"2450",2450,"Exodus",2,32,11,"But Moses praied vnto the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, why doeth thy wrath waxe hote against thy people, which thou hast brought out of the lande of Egypt, with great power and with a mightie hand?"
"2451",2451,"Exodus",2,32,12,"Wherefore shall the Egyptians speake, and say, He hath brought them out maliciously for to slay them in the mountaines, and to consume them from the earth? turne from thy fearce wrath, and change thy minde from this euill towarde thy people."
"2452",2452,"Exodus",2,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Izhak, and Israel thy seruants, to whom thou swarest by thine owne selfe, and saydest vnto them, I wil multiply your seede, as the starres of the heauen, & all this land, that I haue spoken of, wil I giue vnto your seede, and they shal inherit it for euer."
"2453",2453,"Exodus",2,32,14,"Then the Lord changed his minde fro the euil, which he threatned to do vnto his people."
"2454",2454,"Exodus",2,32,15,"So Moses returned and went downe from the mountaine with the two Tables of the Testimonie in his hande: the Tables were written on both their sides, euen on the one side and on the other were they written."
"2455",2455,"Exodus",2,32,16,"And these Tables were the worke of God, and this writing was the writing of God grauen in the Tables."
"2456",2456,"Exodus",2,32,17,"And when Ioshua heard the noyse of the people, as they shouted, he said vnto Moses, There is a noyse of warre in the hoste."
"2457",2457,"Exodus",2,32,18,"Who answered, It is not the noyse of them that haue the victorie, nor the noyse of them that are ouercome: but I do heare ye noyse of singing."
"2458",2458,"Exodus",2,32,19,"Nowe, as soone as he came neere vnto the hoste, he sawe the calfe and the dancing: so Moses wrath waxed hote, and he cast the Tables out of his handes, and brake them in pieces beneath the mountaine."
"2459",2459,"Exodus",2,32,20,"After, he tooke the calfe, which they had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it vnto powder, and strowed it vpon the water, & made the children of Israel drinke of it."
"2460",2460,"Exodus",2,32,21,"Also Moses said vnto Aaron, What did this people vnto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them?"
"2461",2461,"Exodus",2,32,22,"Then Aaron answered, Let not the wrath of my Lord waxe fearce: Thou knowest this people, that they are euen set on mischiefe."
"2462",2462,"Exodus",2,32,23,"And they sayde vnto me, Make vs gods to go before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses (the man that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.)"
"2463",2463,"Exodus",2,32,24,"Then I sayde to them, Ye that haue golde, plucke it off: and they brought it me, & I did cast it into the fire, and thereof came this calfe."
"2464",2464,"Exodus",2,32,25,"Moses therefore sawe that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked vnto their shame among their enemies)"
"2465",2465,"Exodus",2,32,26,"And Moses stoode in ye gate of the campe, and sayde, Who pertaineth to the Lorde? let him come to mee; all the sonnes of Leui gathered themselues vnto him."
"2466",2466,"Exodus",2,32,27,"Then he said vnto them, Thus sayth ye Lord God of Israel, Put euery man his sworde by his side: go to and fro, from gate to gate, through the hoste, and slay euery man his brother, and euery man his companion, & euery man his neighbour."
"2467",2467,"Exodus",2,32,28,"So the children of Leui did as Moses had commanded: and there fel of the people the same day about three thousand men."
"2468",2468,"Exodus",2,32,29,"(For Moses had said, Cosecrate your hands vnto the Lord this day, euen euery man vpon his sonne, and vpon his brother, that there may be giuen you a blessing this day)"
"2469",2469,"Exodus",2,32,30,"And when the morning came, Moses sayde vnto the people, Yee haue committed a grieuous crime: but now I wil goe vp to the Lord, if I may pacifie him for your sinne."
"2470",2470,"Exodus",2,32,31,"Moses therefore went againe vnto ye Lord, and said, Oh, this people haue sinned a great sinne, and haue made them gods of golde."
"2471",2471,"Exodus",2,32,32,"Therefore now if thou pardon their sinne, thy mercy shal appeare: but if thou wilt not, I pray thee, rase me out of thy booke, which thou hast written."
"2472",2472,"Exodus",2,32,33,"Then the Lord sayd to Moses, Whosoeuer hath sinned against me, I will put out of my booke."
"2473",2473,"Exodus",2,32,34,"Go nowe therefore, bring the people vnto the place which I commanded thee: behold, mine Angel shal goe before thee, but yet in the day of my visitation I wil visite their sinne vpon them."
"2474",2474,"Exodus",2,32,35,"So the Lorde plagued the people, because they caused Aaro to make ye calfe which he made."
"2475",2475,"Exodus",2,33,1,"Afterward the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Depart, goe vp from hence, thou, and the people (which thou hast brought vp out of lande of Egypt) vnto the lande which I sware vnto Abraham, to Izhak and to Iaakob, saying, Vnto thy seede will I giue it."
"2476",2476,"Exodus",2,33,2,"And I will send an Angel before thee & will cast out the Canaanites, the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, the Hiuites, and the Iebusites:"
"2477",2477,"Exodus",2,33,3,"To a lande, I say, that floweth with milke and hony: for I will not goe vp with thee, because thou art a stiffe necked people, least I consume thee in the way."
"2478",2478,"Exodus",2,33,4,"And when the people heard this euill tydings, they sorowed, and no man put on his best rayment."
"2479",2479,"Exodus",2,33,5,"(For the Lord had said to Moses, Say vnto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffe necked people, I wil come suddenly vpon thee, and consume thee: therefore now put thy costly rayment from thee, that I may know what to do vnto thee)"
"2480",2480,"Exodus",2,33,6,"So the children of Israel layed their good raiment from them, after Moses came downe from the mount Horeb."
"2481",2481,"Exodus",2,33,7,"Then Moses tooke his tabernacle, and pitched it without the host farre off from the hoste, & called it Ohel-moed; whe any did seeke to the Lord, he went out vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, which was without the hoste."
"2482",2482,"Exodus",2,33,8,"And when Moses went out vnto the Tabernacle, all the people rose vp, and stood euery man at his tent doore, and looked after Moses, vntil he was gone into the Tabernacle."
"2483",2483,"Exodus",2,33,9,"And assoone as Moses was entred into the Tabernacle, the cloudie pillar descended & stood at the doore of the Tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses."
"2484",2484,"Exodus",2,33,10,"Nowe when all the people saw the cloudie pillar stand at the Tabernacle doore, all the people rose vp, and worshipped euery man in his tent doore."
"2485",2485,"Exodus",2,33,11,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, face to face, as a man speaketh vnto his friende. After he turned againe into the hoste, but his seruant Ioshua the sonne of Nun a yong man, departed not out of the Tabernacle."
"2486",2486,"Exodus",2,33,12,"Then Moses sayde vnto the Lorde, See, thou sayest vnto me, Leade this people forth, and thou hast not shewed me whom thou wilt sende with mee: thou hast sayde moreouer, I knowe thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight."
"2487",2487,"Exodus",2,33,13,"Nowe therefore, I pray thee, if I haue founde fauour in thy sight, shewe mee nowe thy way, that I may knowe thee, and that I may finde grace in thy sight: consider also that this nation is thy people."
"2488",2488,"Exodus",2,33,14,"And he answered, My presence shal go with thee, and I will giue thee rest."
"2489",2489,"Exodus",2,33,15,"Then he sayd vnto him, If thy presence go not with vs, cary vs not hence."
"2490",2490,"Exodus",2,33,16,"And wherein nowe shal it be knowen, that I and thy people haue found fauour in thy sight? Shall it not be when thou goest with vs? so I, and thy people shall haue preeminence before all the people that are vpon the earth."
"2491",2491,"Exodus",2,33,17,"And the Lord sayde vnto Moses, I will doe this also that thou hast saide: for thou hast founde grace in my sight, and I knowe thee by name."
"2492",2492,"Exodus",2,33,18,"Againe he sayde, I beseech thee, shewe me thy glory."
"2493",2493,"Exodus",2,33,19,"And he answered, I wil make all my good go before thee, and I wil proclaime the Name of the Lord before thee: for I will shewe mercy to whom I will shewe mercy, and will haue compassion on whom I will haue compassion."
"2494",2494,"Exodus",2,33,20,"Furthermore he sayde, Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me, and liue."
"2495",2495,"Exodus",2,33,21,"Also the Lord sayd, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand vpon the rocke:"
"2496",2496,"Exodus",2,33,22,"And while my glory passeth by, I will put thee in a cleft of the rocke, and will couer thee with mine hand whiles I passe by."
"2497",2497,"Exodus",2,33,23,"After I will take away mine hande, & thou shalt see my backe parts: but my face shal not be seene."
"2498",2498,"Exodus",2,34,1,"And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Hewe thee two Tables of stone, like vnto the first, and I will write vpon the Tables the wordes that were in the first Tables, which thou brakest in pieces."
"2499",2499,"Exodus",2,34,2,"And be ready in ye morning, that thou mayest come vp earely vnto the mount of Sinai, and waite there for me in the top of the mount."
"2500",2500,"Exodus",2,34,3,"But let no man come vp with thee, neither let any man be seene throughout all the mount, neyther let the sheepe nor cattell feede before this mount."
"2501",2501,"Exodus",2,34,4,"Then Moses hewed two Tables of stone like vnto the first, and rose vp earely in the morning, and went vp vnto the mount of Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, & tooke in his hande two Tables of stone."
"2502",2502,"Exodus",2,34,5,"And the Lorde descended in the cloude, and stoode with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord."
"2503",2503,"Exodus",2,34,6,"So the Lord passed before his face, and cried, The Lord, the Lord, strong, mercifull, & gracious, slowe to anger, and abundant in goodnesse and trueth,"
"2504",2504,"Exodus",2,34,7,"Reseruing mercy for thousands, forgiuing iniquitie, and transgression and sinne, and not making the wicked innocent, visiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon ye children, & vpon childrens children, vnto the third and fourth generation."
"2505",2505,"Exodus",2,34,8,"Then Moses made haste & bowed him selfe to the earth, and worshipped,"
"2506",2506,"Exodus",2,34,9,"And sayde, O Lorde, I pray thee, If I haue founde grace in thy sight, that the Lorde woulde nowe goe with vs ( for it is a stiffe necked people) and pardon our iniquitie and our sinne, and take vs for thine inheritance."
"2507",2507,"Exodus",2,34,10,"And he answered, Behold, I will make a couenant before all thy people, and will do marueiles, such as haue not bene done in all the worlde, neyther in all nations: and all the people among whom thou art, shal see the worke of the Lord: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee."

"2738",2738,"Exodus",2,40,30,"Likewise he set the Lauer betweene the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, and powred water therein to wash with."
"2739",2739,"Exodus",2,40,31,"So Moses and Aaron, and his sonnes washed their handes and their feete thereat."
"2740",2740,"Exodus",2,40,32,"When they went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and when they approched to the Altar, they washed, as the Lord had commanded Moses."

"2742",2742,"Exodus",2,40,34,"Then the cloud couered the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the glorie of the Lorde filled the Tabernacle."
"2743",2743,"Exodus",2,40,35,"So Moses could not enter into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, because the cloude abode thereon, and the glorie of the Lorde filled the Tabernacle."
"2744",2744,"Exodus",2,40,36,"Nowe when the cloude ascended vp from the Tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward in all their iourneyes."

"2853",2853,"Leviticus",3,6,3,"Or hath found that which was lost, and denieth it, and sweareth falsely, for any of these things that a man doeth, wherein he sinneth:"
"2854",2854,"Leviticus",3,6,4,"When, I say, he thus sinneth & trespasseth, he shall then restore the robbery that he robbed, or the thing taken by violence which hee tooke by force, or the thing which was deliuered him to keepe, or the lost thing which he founde,"
"2855",2855,"Leviticus",3,6,5,"Or for whatsoeuer he hath sworne falsely, he shall both restore it in the whole summe, and shall adde the fift parte more thereto, and giue it vnto him to whome perteyneth, the same day that he offreth for trespasse."
"2856",2856,"Leviticus",3,6,6,"Also he shall bring for his trespasse vnto the Lorde, a ramme without blemish out of the flocke in thy estimation worth two shekels for a trespasse offring vnto the Priest."
"2857",2857,"Leviticus",3,6,7,"And the Priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lorde, and it shall be forgiuen him, whatsoeuer thing he hath done, and trespassed therein."
"2858",2858,"Leviticus",3,6,8,"Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"2859",2859,"Leviticus",3,6,9,"Commaund Aaron and his sonnes, saying, This is the lawe of the burnt offring, (it is the burnt offring because it burneth vpon the altar al the night vnto the morning, and the fire burneth on the altar)"
"2860",2860,"Leviticus",3,6,10,"And the Priest shall put on his linen garment, and shall put on his linen breeches vpon his flesh, and take away the ashes when the fire hath consumed the burnt offring vpon the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar."
"2861",2861,"Leviticus",3,6,11,"After, he shal put off his garments, and put on other raiment, and cary the ashes foorth without the hoste vnto a cleane place."
"2862",2862,"Leviticus",3,6,12,"But the fire vpon the altar shall burne thereon and neuer be put out: wherefore the Priest shall burne wood on it euery morning, and lay the burnt offering in order vpon it, and he shall burne thereon the fat of the peace offrings."
"2863",2863,"Leviticus",3,6,13,"The fire shall euer burne vpon the altar, and neuer go out."
"2864",2864,"Leviticus",3,6,14,"Also this is the lawe of the meate offring, which Aarons sonnes shall offer in the presence of the Lorde, before the altar."
"2865",2865,"Leviticus",3,6,15,"He shall euen take thence his handfull of fine flowre of the meate offring and of the oyle, & all the incense which is vpon the meat offring, and shall burne it vpon the altar for a sweete sauour, as a memoriall therefore vnto the Lorde:"

"2879",2879,"Leviticus",3,6,29,"All the males among the Priestes shal eate thereof, for it is most holy."
"2880",2880,"Leviticus",3,6,30,"But no sinne offering, whose blood is brought into the Tabernacle of the Congregation to make reconciliation in the holy place, shalbe eaten, but shalbe burnt in the fire."
"2881",2881,"Leviticus",3,7,1,"Likewise this is the lawe of the trespasse offering, it is most holy."
"2882",2882,"Leviticus",3,7,2,"In the place where they kill the burnt offering, shall they kill the trespasse offering, and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle rounde about vpon the altar."

"2897",2897,"Leviticus",3,7,17,"But as much of the offered flesh as remaineth vnto the third day, shalbe burnt with fire."
"2898",2898,"Leviticus",3,7,18,"For if any of the flesh of his peace offrings be eaten in the third day, he shall not be accepted that offereth it, neither shall it be reckoned vnto him, but shalbe an abomination: therefore ye person that eateth of it shall beare his iniquitie."
"2899",2899,"Leviticus",3,7,19,"The flesh also that toucheth any vncleane thing, shall not be eaten, but burnt with fire: but of this flesh all that be cleane shal eate thereof."

"2913",2913,"Leviticus",3,7,33,"The same that offreth the blood of ye peace offrings, and the fatte, among the sonnes of Aaron, shall haue the right shoulder for his parte."
"2914",2914,"Leviticus",3,7,34,"For the breast shaken to and fro, and the shoulder lifted vp, haue I taken of the children of Israel, euen of their peace offrings, and haue giuen them vnto Aaron the Priest and vnto his sonnes by a statute for euer from among the children of Israel."
"2915",2915,"Leviticus",3,7,35,"This is the anointing of Aaron, & the anointing of his sonnes, concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day when he presented them to serue in the Priestes office vnto the Lorde."
"2916",2916,"Leviticus",3,7,36,"The which portions the Lorde commanded to giue them in the day that he anointed them from among the children of Israel, by a statute for euer in their generations."
"2917",2917,"Leviticus",3,7,37,"This is also the lawe of the burnt offring of the meate offring, and of the sinne offring, and of the trespasse offring, and of the consecrations, and of the peace offrings,"

"2921",2921,"Leviticus",3,8,3,"And assemble all the company at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
"2922",2922,"Leviticus",3,8,4,"So Moses did as the Lord had commanded him, & the companie was assembled at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
"2923",2923,"Leviticus",3,8,5,"Then Moses said vnto the company, This is the thing which the Lorde hath commaunded to doe."
"2924",2924,"Leviticus",3,8,6,"And Moses brought Aaron and his sonnes, and washed them with water,"
"2925",2925,"Leviticus",3,8,7,"And put vpon him the coate, and girded him with a girdle, & clothed him with the robe, and put the Ephod on him, which he girded with the broydred garde of the Ephod, and bounde it vnto him therewith."
"2926",2926,"Leviticus",3,8,8,"After he put the brest plate thereon, and put in the breast plate the Vrim and the Thummim."
"2927",2927,"Leviticus",3,8,9,"Also he put the miter vpon his head, and put vpon the miter on the fore front the golden plate, and the holy crowne, as the Lorde had commanded Moses."
"2928",2928,"Leviticus",3,8,10,"(Nowe Moses had taken the anointing oyle, and anoynted the Tabernacle, and al that was therein, and sanctified them,"

"2931",2931,"Leviticus",3,8,13,"After, Moses brought Aarons sonnes, and put coates vpon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonets vpon their heades, as the Lorde had commanded Moses."
"2932",2932,"Leviticus",3,8,14,"Then he brought the bullocke for the sinne offring, and Aaron and his sonnes put their handes vpon the head of the bullocke for the sinne offring."
"2933",2933,"Leviticus",3,8,15,"And Moses slew him, and tooke the blood, which he put vpon the hornes of the Altar roud about with his finger, and purified the altar, & powred the rest of the blood at the foote of ye altar: so he sanctified it, to make reconciliation vpon it."
"2934",2934,"Leviticus",3,8,16,"Then he tooke all the fatte that was vpon the inwardes, and the kall of the liuer and the two kidneis, with their fat, which Moses burned vpon the Altar."
"2935",2935,"Leviticus",3,8,17,"But the bullocke and his hide, and his flesh, and his doung, hee burnt with fire without the host as the Lord had commanded Moses."
"2936",2936,"Leviticus",3,8,18,"Also hee brought the ram for the burnt offring, and Aaron and his sonnes put their hands vpon the head of the ramme."
"2937",2937,"Leviticus",3,8,19,"So Moses killed it, and sprinkled the blood vpon the Altar round about,"
"2938",2938,"Leviticus",3,8,20,"And Moses cut the ram in pieces, & burnt the head with the pieces, and the fat,"
"2939",2939,"Leviticus",3,8,21,"And washed the inwardes and the legges in water: so Moses burnt the ram euery whit vpon ye Altar: for it was a burnt offring for a sweete sauour, which was made by fire vnto the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
"2940",2940,"Leviticus",3,8,22,"After, he brought the other ram, the ram of consecrations, and Aaron and his sonnes layed their handes vpon the head of the ram,"
"2941",2941,"Leviticus",3,8,23,"Which Moses slewe, and tooke of the blood of it, and put it vpon the lappe of Aarons right eare, & vpon the thumbe of his right hand, and vpon the great toe of his right foote."
"2942",2942,"Leviticus",3,8,24,"Then Moses brought Aarons sonnes, and put of the blood on the lap of their right eares, and vpon the thumbes of their right handes, and vpon the great toes of their right feete, and Moses sprinckled the rest of the blood vpon the Altar round about."
"2943",2943,"Leviticus",3,8,25,"And he tooke the fat & the rumpe and all the fat that was vpon the inwards, and the kall of the liuer, and the two kidneis with their fat, & the right shoulder."
"2944",2944,"Leviticus",3,8,26,"Also he tooke of ye basket of ye vnleauened bread that was before the Lorde, one vnleauened cake and a cake of oiled bread, & one wafer, and put them on the fat, & vpon the right shoulder."
"2945",2945,"Leviticus",3,8,27,"So hee put all in Aarons handes, and in his sonnes handes, and shooke it to and fro before the Lord."
"2946",2946,"Leviticus",3,8,28,"After, Moses tooke the out of their hands, & burnt them vpon the altar for a burnt offring: for these were consecrations for a sweete sauour which were made by fire vnto the Lord."
"2947",2947,"Leviticus",3,8,29,"Likewise Moses tooke the breast of the ram of consecrations, & shooke it to and fro before the Lord: for it was Moses portion, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
"2948",2948,"Leviticus",3,8,30,"Also Moses tooke of the anointing oyle, and of the blood which was vpon the Altar, and sprinkled it vpon Aaron, vpon his garments, and vpon his sonnes, and on his sonnes garments with him: so hee sanctified Aaron, his garments, & his sonnes, and his sonnes garments with him."
"2949",2949,"Leviticus",3,8,31,"Afterward Moses saide vnto Aaron and his sonnes, Seethe the flesh at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, & there eate it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sonnes shall eate it,"
"2950",2950,"Leviticus",3,8,32,"But that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread, shall ye burne with fire."
"2951",2951,"Leviticus",3,8,33,"And ye shall not depart from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation seuen dayes, vntill the dayes of your consecrations bee at an ende: for seuen dayes, saide the Lorde, shall hee consecrate you,"
"2952",2952,"Leviticus",3,8,34,"As hee hath done this day: so the Lorde hath commanded to doe, to make an atonement for you."
"2953",2953,"Leviticus",3,8,35,"Therefore shall yee abide at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation day and night, seuen dayes, and shall keepe the watch of the Lord, that ye dye not: for so I am commanded."
"2954",2954,"Leviticus",3,8,36,"So Aaron and his sonnes did all thinges which the Lorde had commanded by the hand of Moses."
"2955",2955,"Leviticus",3,9,1,"And in the eight day Moses called Aaron and his sonnes, and the Elders of Israel:"
"2956",2956,"Leviticus",3,9,2,"Then hee sayde vnto Aaron, Take thee a yong calfe for a sinne offring, and a ram for a burnt offring, both without blemish, and bring them before the Lord."
"2957",2957,"Leviticus",3,9,3,"And vnto the children of Israel thou shalt speake, saying, Take yee an hee goate for a sinne offring, and a calfe, and a lambe, both of a yeere olde, without blemish for a burnt offring:"
"2958",2958,"Leviticus",3,9,4,"Also a bullock, and a ramme for peace offringes, to offer before the Lorde, and a meate offring mingled with oyle: for to day the Lorde will appeare vnto you."
"2959",2959,"Leviticus",3,9,5,"Then they brought that which Moses commanded before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and all the assembly drewe neere and stood before the Lord."
"2960",2960,"Leviticus",3,9,6,"(For Moses had sayde, This is the thing, which the Lord commaunded that ye should do, and the glory of the Lord shal appeare vnto you)"
"2961",2961,"Leviticus",3,9,7,"Then Moses sayd vnto Aaron, Draw neere to the Altar, and offer thy sinne offering, and thy burnt offring, and make an attonement for thee and for the people: offer also the offring of the people, and make an atonement for them, as the Lord hath commaunded."
"2962",2962,"Leviticus",3,9,8,"Aaron therefore went vnto the Altar, and killed the calfe of the sinne offring, which was for himselfe."
"2963",2963,"Leviticus",3,9,9,"And the sonnes of Aaron brought ye blood vnto him, and he dipt his finger in the blood, and put it vpon the hornes of the Altar, and powred the rest of the blood at the foote of the Altar."
"2964",2964,"Leviticus",3,9,10,"But the fat and the kidneis and the kall of the liuer of the sinne offring, he burnt vpon the Altar, as the Lord had commaunded Moses."
"2965",2965,"Leviticus",3,9,11,"The flesh also and the hide hee burnt with fire without the hoste."
"2966",2966,"Leviticus",3,9,12,"After, he slewe the burnt offering, and Aarons sonnes brought vnto him the blood, which he sprinckled round about vpon the Altar."
"2967",2967,"Leviticus",3,9,13,"Also they brought the burnt offring vnto him with the pieces thereof, and the head, and he burnt them vpon the Altar."
"2968",2968,"Leviticus",3,9,14,"Likewise he did wash the inwardes and the legs, and burnt them vpon the burnt offring on the Altar."
"2969",2969,"Leviticus",3,9,15,"Then he offred the peoples offring, and tooke a goate, which was the sinne offring for the people, and slewe it: and offred it for sinne, as the first:"
"2970",2970,"Leviticus",3,9,16,"So he offred the burnt offring, and prepared it, according to the maner."
"2971",2971,"Leviticus",3,9,17,"He presented also the meate offring, & filled his hand thereof, and beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning he burnt this vpon the Altar."
"2972",2972,"Leviticus",3,9,18,"He slewe also the bullock, and the ram for the peace offrings, that was for the people, and Arons sonnes brought vnto him the blood, which he sprinkled vpon the Altar round about,"
"2973",2973,"Leviticus",3,9,19,"With the fat of the bullocke, and of the ram, the rumpe, and that which couereth the inwards and the kidneis, and the kall of the liuer."
"2974",2974,"Leviticus",3,9,20,"So they layed the fat vpon the breasts, and he burnt the fat vpon the Altar."
"2975",2975,"Leviticus",3,9,21,"But the breastes and the ryght shoulder Aaron shooke to and fro before the Lord, as the Lord had commaunded Moses."
"2976",2976,"Leviticus",3,9,22,"So Aaron lift vp his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came downe from offring of the sinne offring, and the burnt offring, and the peace offrings."
"2977",2977,"Leviticus",3,9,23,"After, Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and came out, and blessed the people, and the glorie of the Lord appeared to all the people."
"2978",2978,"Leviticus",3,9,24,"And there came a fire out from the Lord and consumed vpon the Altar the burnt offring and the fatte: which when all the people sawe, they gaue thankes, and fell on their faces."
"2979",2979,"Leviticus",3,10,1,"Bvt Nadab and Abihu, the sonnes of Aaron, tooke either of them his censor, and put fire therein, and put incense thereupon, and offred strange fire before the Lorde, which hee had not commaunded them."
"2980",2980,"Leviticus",3,10,2,"Therefore a fire went out from the Lord, & deuoured them: so they dyed before the Lord."
"2981",2981,"Leviticus",3,10,3,"Then Moses sayde vnto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will bee sanctified in the that come neere me, & before all the people I will be glorified: but Aaron held his peace."
"2982",2982,"Leviticus",3,10,4,"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sonnes of Vzziel, the vncle of Aaron, & saide vnto them, Come neere, cary your brethre from before the Sanctuarie out of the hoste."
"2983",2983,"Leviticus",3,10,5,"Then they went, and caried them in their coates out of the host, as Moses had comaunded."
"2984",2984,"Leviticus",3,10,6,"After, Moses saide vnto Aaron and vnto Eleazar & Ithamar his sonnes, Vncouer not your heads, neither rent your clothes, least ye dye, and least wrath come vpon all ye people: but let your brethren, all the house of Israel bewayle the burning which the Lorde hath kindled."
"2985",2985,"Leviticus",3,10,7,"And go not yee out from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, least ye dye: for the anointing oyle of the Lorde is vpon you: and they did according to Moses commaundement."
"2986",2986,"Leviticus",3,10,8,"And the Lorde spake vnto Aaron, saying,"
"2987",2987,"Leviticus",3,10,9,"Thou shalt not drinke wine nor strong drinke, thou, nor thy sonnes with thee, when yee come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, lest ye die: this is an ordinance for euer throughout your generations,"

"3209",3209,"Leviticus",3,16,7,"And he shal take the two hee goates, and present them before the Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
"3210",3210,"Leviticus",3,16,8,"Then Aaron shal cast lots ouer the two hee goates: one lot for the Lord, and the other for the Scape goate."

"3226",3226,"Leviticus",3,16,24,"Hee shal wash also his flesh with water in the Holy place, and put on his owne rayment, and come out, and make his burnt offring, & the burnt offring of the people, and make an atonement for himselfe, and for the people."
"3227",3227,"Leviticus",3,16,25,"Also the fatte of the sinne offring shal he burne vpon the altar."
"3228",3228,"Leviticus",3,16,26,"And he that caried forth the goat, called the Scape goat, shal wash his clothes, & wash his flesh in water, and after that shal come into the hoste."
"3229",3229,"Leviticus",3,16,27,"Also the bullocke for the sinne offring, & the goate for the sinne offring (whose blood was brought to make a reconciliation in the Holy place) shal one carie out without the hoste to be burnt in the fire, with their skinnes, and with their flesh, and with their doung."

"3232",3232,"Leviticus",3,16,30,"For that day shal ye Priest make an atonement for you to clense you: ye shalbe cleane from all your sinnes before the Lord."
"3233",3233,"Leviticus",3,16,31,"This shall be a Sabbath of rest vnto you, and ye shal humble your soules, by an ordinance for euer."
"3234",3234,"Leviticus",3,16,32,"And the Priest whom he shal anoynt, & whom he shal cosecrate (to minister in his fathers steade) shal make the atonement, & shal put on the linnen clothes and Holy vestments,"

"3516",3516,"Leviticus",3,25,46,"So ye shall take them as inheritance for your children after you, to possesse them by inheritance, ye shall vse their labours for euer: but ouer your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule one ouer another with crueltie."
"3517",3517,"Leviticus",3,25,47,"If a soiourner or a stranger dwelling by thee get riches, & thy brother by him be impouerished, and sell him selfe vnto the stranger or soiourner dwelling by thee, or to the stocke of the strangers familie,"

"3954",3954,"Numbers",4,8,14,"Thus thou shalt separate the Leuites from among the children of Israel, and the Leuites shal be mine."
"3955",3955,"Numbers",4,8,15,"And afterwarde shall the Leuites goe in, to serue in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou shalt purifie them and offer them, as a shake offering."
"3956",3956,"Numbers",4,8,16,"For they are freely giuen vnto me from among the children of Israel, for such as open any wombe: for all the first borne of the children of Israel haue I taken them vnto me."
"3957",3957,"Numbers",4,8,17,"For all the first borne of the children of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast: since the day that I smote euery first borne in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for my selfe."
"3958",3958,"Numbers",4,8,18,"And I haue taken the Leuites for all the first borne of the children of Israel,"
"3959",3959,"Numbers",4,8,19,"And haue giuen the Leuites as a gift vnto Aaron, and to his sonnes from among the children of Israel, to do the seruice of the children of Israel in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come neere vnto the Sanctuarie."
"3960",3960,"Numbers",4,8,20,"Then Moses and Aaron and all the Cogregation of the children of Israel did with the Leuites, according vnto all that the Lorde had commanded Moses concerning the Leuites: so did the children of Israel vnto them."
"3961",3961,"Numbers",4,8,21,"So the Leuites were purified, and washed their clothes, and Aaron offred them as a shake offring before the Lord, and Aaron made an atonement for them, to purifie them."
"3962",3962,"Numbers",4,8,22,"And after that, went the Leuites in to doe their seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before Aaron and before his sonnes: as the Lorde had commaunded Moses concerning the Leuites, so they did vnto them."
"3963",3963,"Numbers",4,8,23,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"3964",3964,"Numbers",4,8,24,"This also belongeth to the Leuites: from fiue and twentie yeere olde and vpwarde, they shall goe in, to execute their office in the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
"3965",3965,"Numbers",4,8,25,"And after the age of fiftie yeere, they shall cease from executing the office, and shall serue no more:"
"3966",3966,"Numbers",4,8,26,"But they shal minister with their brethre in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to keepe things committed to their charge, but they shall doe no seruice: thus shalt thou doe vnto the Leuites touching their charges."
"3967",3967,"Numbers",4,9,1,"And the Lorde spake vnto Moses in the wildernes of Sinai, in the first moneth of the second yeere, after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,"
"3968",3968,"Numbers",4,9,2,"The children of Israel shall also celebrate the Passeouer at ye time appointed thereunto."
"3969",3969,"Numbers",4,9,3,"In the fourtenth day of this moneth at euen, ye shall keepe it in his due season: according to all the ordinances of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keepe it."
"3970",3970,"Numbers",4,9,4,"Then Moses spake vnto the children of Israel, to celebrate the Passeouer."
"3971",3971,"Numbers",4,9,5,"And they kept the Passeouer in the fouretenth day of the first moneth at euen in the wildernesse of Sinai: according to all that the Lord had comanded Moses, so did ye children of Israel."
"3972",3972,"Numbers",4,9,6,"And certaine men were defiled by a dead man, that they might not keepe the Passeouer the same day: and they came before Moses & before Aaron the same day."
"3973",3973,"Numbers",4,9,7,"And those men said vnto him, We are defiled by a dead man: wherefore are wee kept backe that we may not offer an offering vnto the Lorde in the time thereunto appointed among the children of Israel?"
"3974",3974,"Numbers",4,9,8,"Then Moses saide vnto them, Stande still, and I will heare what the Lorde will commande concerning you."
"3975",3975,"Numbers",4,9,9,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"3976",3976,"Numbers",4,9,10,"Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, If any amog you, or of your posteritie shalbe vncleane by ye reason of a corps, or be in a log iourney, he shall keepe the Passeouer vnto ye Lord."
"3977",3977,"Numbers",4,9,11,"In the fourtenth day of the second moneth at euen they shall keepe it: with vnleauened bread and sowre herbes shall they eate it."
"3978",3978,"Numbers",4,9,12,"They shall leaue none of it vnto the morning, nor breake any bone of it: according to all the ordinance of the Passeouer shall they keepe it."
"3979",3979,"Numbers",4,9,13,"But the man that is cleane and is not in a iourney, and is negligent to keepe the Passeouer, the same person shalbe cut off from his people: because he brought not the offring of the Lorde in his due season, that man shall beare his sinne."
"3980",3980,"Numbers",4,9,14,"And if a stranger dwell among you, and wil keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord, as the ordinance of the Passeouer, & as the maner thereof is, so shall he do: ye shall haue one lawe both for the stranger, and for him that was borne in the same lande."
"3981",3981,"Numbers",4,9,15,"And when the Tabernacle was reared vp, a cloude couered the Tabernacle, namely the Tabernacle of the Testimonie: and at euen there was vpon the Tabernacle, as the appearance of fire vntill the morning."
"3982",3982,"Numbers",4,9,16,"So it was always: the cloude couered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night."
"3983",3983,"Numbers",4,9,17,"And when the cloude was taken vp from the Tabernacle, then afterwarde the children of Israel iourneyed: and in the place where the cloude abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents."
"3984",3984,"Numbers",4,9,18,"At the commaundement of the Lorde the children of Israel iourneyed, and at the comandement of the Lorde they pitched: as long as the cloude abode vpon the Tabernacle, they lay still."
"3985",3985,"Numbers",4,9,19,"And when the cloude taryed stil vpon the Tabernacle a long time, the childre of Israel kept the watch of the Lorde, and iourneyed not."
"3986",3986,"Numbers",4,9,20,"So when the cloud abode a few dayes vpon the Tabernacle, they abode in their tents according to the comandement of ye Lord: for they iourneyed at the commandement of the Lorde."
"3987",3987,"Numbers",4,9,21,"And though the cloud abode vpo the Tabernacle from euen vnto the morning, yet if the cloude was taken vp in the morning, then they iourneyed: whether by daye or by night the cloude was taken vp, then they iourneyed."
"3988",3988,"Numbers",4,9,22,"Or if the cloude taryed two dayes or a moneth, or a yeere vpon the Tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel abode still, and iourneyed not: but when it was taken vp, they iourneyed."
"3989",3989,"Numbers",4,9,23,"At the commandement of the Lord they pitched, and at the commandement of the Lorde they iourneyed, keeping the watch of the Lorde at the commaundement of the Lorde by the hand of Moses."
"3990",3990,"Numbers",4,10,1,"And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"3991",3991,"Numbers",4,10,2,"Make thee two trumpets of siluer: of an whole piece shalt thou make the, that thou mayest vse them for the assembling of the Congregation, and for the departure of the campe."
"3992",3992,"Numbers",4,10,3,"And when they shall blowe with them, all the Congregation shall assemble to thee before the doore of the Tabernacle of the Cogregation."
"3993",3993,"Numbers",4,10,4,"But if they blowe with one, then the princes, or heades ouer the thousandes of Israel shall come vnto thee."
"3994",3994,"Numbers",4,10,5,"But if ye blow an alarme, then the campe of the that pitch on the East part, shal go forward."
"3995",3995,"Numbers",4,10,6,"If ye blowe an alarme the second time, then the hoste of them that lie on the Southside shal march: for they shal blowe an alarme when they remoue."
"3996",3996,"Numbers",4,10,7,"But in assembling the Congregation, ye shall blowe without an alarme."
"3997",3997,"Numbers",4,10,8,"And the sonnes of Aaron the Priest shall blowe the trumpets, and ye shall haue them as a lawe for euer in your generations."
"3998",3998,"Numbers",4,10,9,"And when ye goe to warre in your lande against the enemie that vexeth you, ye shall blowe an alarme with the trumpets, and ye shall bee remembred before the Lorde your God, and shalbe saued from your enemies."
"3999",3999,"Numbers",4,10,10,"Also in the day of your gladnesse, and in your feast dayes, & in the beginning of your moneths, ye shal also blow the trumpets ouer your burnt sacrifices, and ouer your peace offrings, that they may be a remembrance for you before your God: I am the Lorde your God."
"4000",4000,"Numbers",4,10,11,"And in the seconde yeere, in the seconde moneth, and in the twentieth day of the moneth the cloude was taken vp from the Tabernacle of the Testimonie."
"4001",4001,"Numbers",4,10,12,"And ye children of Israel departed on their iourneys out of the desart of Sinai, & the cloud rested in the wildernesse of Paran."
"4002",4002,"Numbers",4,10,13,"So they first tooke their iourney at the comandement of the Lord, by ye hand of Moses."
"4003",4003,"Numbers",4,10,14,"In the first place went the standerd of the hoste of the children of Iudah, according to their armies: and Nahshon the sonne of Amminabad was ouer his band."

"4018",4018,"Numbers",4,10,29,"After, Moses said vnto Hobab ye sonne of Reuel the Midianite, ye father in law of Moses, We go into the place, of which ye Lord said, I will giue it you: Come thou with vs, & we wil doe thee good: for ye Lord hath promised good vnto Israel."
"4019",4019,"Numbers",4,10,30,"And he answered him, I will not goe: but I will depart to mine owne countrey, and to my kindred."

"4023",4023,"Numbers",4,10,34,"And the cloude of the Lord was vpon the by day, when they went out of the campe."
"4024",4024,"Numbers",4,10,35,"And when the Arke went forwarde, Moses saide, Rise vp, Lord, & let thine enemies bee scattered, & let them that hate thee, flee before thee."
"4025",4025,"Numbers",4,10,36,"And when it rested, hee sayde, Returne, O Lord, to the many thousands of Israel."
"4026",4026,"Numbers",4,11,1,"Vvhen the people became murmurers, it displeased the Lorde: and the Lorde heard it, therefore his wrath was kindled, and the fire of the Lorde burnt among them, and consumed the vtmost parte of the hoste."
"4027",4027,"Numbers",4,11,2,"Then the people cryed vnto Moses: and when Moses praied vnto the Lorde, the fire was quenched."
"4028",4028,"Numbers",4,11,3,"And he called the name of that place Taberah, because the fire of the Lorde burnt among them."
"4029",4029,"Numbers",4,11,4,"And a nomber of people that was amog them, fell a lusting, and turned away, and the children of Israel also wept, and saide, Who shall giue vs flesh to eate?"

"4034",4034,"Numbers",4,11,9,"And when the dewe fell downe vpon the hoste in the night, the Man fell with it)"
"4035",4035,"Numbers",4,11,10,"Then Moses heard the people weepe throughout their families, euery man in the doore of his tent, and the wrath of the Lord was grieuously kindled: also Moses was grieued."
"4036",4036,"Numbers",4,11,11,"And Moses saide vnto the Lorde, Wherefore hast thou vexed thy seruant? And why haue I not found fauour in thy sight, seeing thou hast put the charge of al this people vpon mee?"
"4037",4037,"Numbers",4,11,12,"Haue I conceiued al this people? Or haue I begotte them, that thou shouldest say vnto me, Cary them in thy bosome (as a nurse beareth the sucking childe) vnto the lande, for the which thou swarest vnto their fathers?"
"4038",4038,"Numbers",4,11,13,"Where should I haue flesh to giue vnto al this people? For they weepe vnto me, saying, Giue vs flesh that we may eate."

"4040",4040,"Numbers",4,11,15,"Therefore if thou deale thus with mee, I pray thee, if I haue founde fauour in thy sight, kill me, that I behold not my miserie."
"4041",4041,"Numbers",4,11,16,"Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Gather vnto me seuetie men of ye Elders of Israel, whome thou knowest, that they are the Elders of the people, and gouernonrs ouer them, & bring them vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and let them stand there with thee,"
"4042",4042,"Numbers",4,11,17,"And I will come downe, and talke with thee there, and take of the Spirite, which is vpon thee, and put vpon them, and they shall beare the burthen of the people with thee: so thou shalt not beare it alone."
"4043",4043,"Numbers",4,11,18,"Furthermore thou shalt saye vnto the people, Bee sanctified against to morowe, and yee shall eate flesh: for you haue wept in the eares of the Lord, saying, Who shall giue vs flesh to eate? For we were better in Egypt: therefore the Lorde will giue you flesh, and ye shall eate."
"4044",4044,"Numbers",4,11,19,"Ye shal not eat one day nor two daies, nor fiue daies, neither ten daies, nor twentie dayes,"
"4045",4045,"Numbers",4,11,20,"But a whole moneth, vntill it come out at your nostrels, and bee lothesome vnto you, because ye haue contemned the Lorde, which is among you, and haue wept before him, saying, Why came we hither out of Egypt?"
"4046",4046,"Numbers",4,11,21,"And Moses saide, Six hundreth thousande footemen are there of the people, among whom I am: and thou saiest, I will giue them flesh, that they may eate a moneth long."
"4047",4047,"Numbers",4,11,22,"Shall the sheepe and the beeues be slaine for them, to finde them? Either shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them?"
"4048",4048,"Numbers",4,11,23,"And the Lorde saide vnto Moses, Is the Lordes hand shortened? Thou shalt see now whether my word shal come to passe vnto thee, or no."
"4049",4049,"Numbers",4,11,24,"So Moses went out, and told the people the wordes of the Lorde, and gathered seuentie men of the Elders of the people, and set them round about the Tabernacle."
"4050",4050,"Numbers",4,11,25,"Then the Lord came downe in a cloude, and spake vnto him, and tooke of the Spirit that was vpon him, and put it vpon the seuentie Ancient men: & when the Spirit rested vpon them, then they prophecied, and did not cease."
"4051",4051,"Numbers",4,11,26,"But there remained two of the men in the hoste: the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad, and the Spirit rested vpon them, (for they were of them that were written, and went not out vnto the Tabernacle) and they prophecied in the hoste."
"4052",4052,"Numbers",4,11,27,"Then there ranne a yong man, and tolde Moses, and saide, Eldad and Medad doe prophesie in the hoste."
"4053",4053,"Numbers",4,11,28,"And Ioshua the sonne of Nun the seruant of Moses one of his yong men answered & said, My lord Moses, forbid them."
"4054",4054,"Numbers",4,11,29,"But Moses saide vnto him, Enuiest thou for my sake? yea, would God that all the Lordes people were Prophets, and that the Lord woulde put his Spirit vpon them."
"4055",4055,"Numbers",4,11,30,"And Moses returned into the hoste, he and the Elders of Israel."
"4056",4056,"Numbers",4,11,31,"Then there went foorth a winde from the Lorde, and brought quailes from the Sea, and let them fall vpon the campe, a dayes iourney on this side, and a dayes iourney on the other side, round about the hoste, and they were about two cubites aboue the earth."
"4057",4057,"Numbers",4,11,32,"Then the people arose, al that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quailes: he that gathered the least, gathered ten Homers full, and they spred them abroade for their vse round about the hoste."
"4058",4058,"Numbers",4,11,33,"While the flesh was yet betweene their teeth, before it was chewed, euen the wrath of the Lorde was kindled against the people, and the Lorde smote the people with an exceeding great plague."
"4059",4059,"Numbers",4,11,34,"So the name of the place was called, Kibroth-hattaauah: for there they buried the people that fell a lusting."
"4060",4060,"Numbers",4,11,35,"From Kibroth-hattaauah ye people tooke their iourney to Hazeroth, & abode at Hazeroth."
"4061",4061,"Numbers",4,12,1,"Afterward Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, because of the woman of Ethiopia whome hee had maried (for hee had married a woman of Ethiopia)"
"4062",4062,"Numbers",4,12,2,"And they saide, What? hath the Lorde spoken but onely by Moses? hath he not spoken also by vs? and the Lord heard this."
"4063",4063,"Numbers",4,12,3,"(But Moses was a verie meeke man, aboue all the men that were vpon the earth)"
"4064",4064,"Numbers",4,12,4,"And by and by the Lorde sayd vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, and vnto Miriam, come out yee three vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and they three came forth."
"4065",4065,"Numbers",4,12,5,"Then the Lorde came downe in the pillar of the cloude, and stoode in the doore of the Tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam, & they both came forth."
"4066",4066,"Numbers",4,12,6,"And hee saide, Heare nowe my wordes, If there be a Prophet of the Lord among you, I will be knowen to him by a vision, and will speake vnto him by dreame."
"4067",4067,"Numbers",4,12,7,"My seruant Moses is not so, who is faithfull in all mine house."
"4068",4068,"Numbers",4,12,8,"Vnto him will I speake mouth to mouth, and by vision, and not in darke wordes, but hee shall see the similitude of the Lorde. Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speake against my seruant, euen against Moses?"
"4069",4069,"Numbers",4,12,9,"Thus the Lorde was very angrie with them, and departed."
"4070",4070,"Numbers",4,12,10,"Also the cloude departed from the Tabernacle: and beholde, Miriam was leprous like snowe: and Aaron looked vpon Miriam, and beholde, she was leprous."
"4071",4071,"Numbers",4,12,11,"Then Aaron saide vnto Moses, Alas, my Lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sinne vpon vs, which we haue foolishly committed and wherein we haue sinned."
"4072",4072,"Numbers",4,12,12,"Let her not, I pray thee, be as one dead, of whome the flesh is halfe consumed, when he commeth out of his mothers wombe."
"4073",4073,"Numbers",4,12,13,"Then Moses cryed vnto the Lord, saying, O God, I beseech thee, heale her nowe."
"4074",4074,"Numbers",4,12,14,"And the Lord said vnto Moses, If her father had spit in her face, shoulde she not haue bene ashamed seuen dayes? let her be shut out of the hoste seuen dayes, and after she shall bee receiued."
"4075",4075,"Numbers",4,12,15,"So Miriam was shut out of the hoste seuen dayes, and the people remooued not, till Miriam was brought in againe."
"4076",4076,"Numbers",4,12,16,"(13:1) Then afterwarde the people remooued from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wildernesse of Paran."
"4077",4077,"Numbers",4,13,1,"(13:2) And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"

"4094",4094,"Numbers",4,13,18,"(13:19) And consider the land what it is, and the people that dwel therein, whether they be strong or weake, either fewe or many,"
"4095",4095,"Numbers",4,13,19,"(13:20) Also what the lande is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad: and what cities they be, that they dwell in, whether they dwell in tents, or in walled townes:"
"4096",4096,"Numbers",4,13,20,"(13:21) And what the land is: whether it be fat or leane, whether there be trees therein, or not. And be of good courage, and bring of the fruite of the lande (for then was the time of the first ripe grapes)"
"4097",4097,"Numbers",4,13,21,"(13:22) So they went vp, and searched out the lande, from the wildernesse of Zin vnto Rehob, to go to Hamath,"
"4098",4098,"Numbers",4,13,22,"(13:23) And they ascended toward the South, and came vnto Hebron, where were Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the sonnes of Anak; Hebron was built seuen yeere before Zoan in Egypt."
"4099",4099,"Numbers",4,13,23,"(13:24) Then they came to the riuer of Eshcol, and cut downe thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it vpon a barre betwene two, and brought of the pomegranates and of the figges."
"4100",4100,"Numbers",4,13,24,"(13:25) That place was called the riuer Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes, which the children of Israel cut downe thence."
"4101",4101,"Numbers",4,13,25,"(13:26) Then after fourtie dayes, they turned againe from searching of the land."
"4102",4102,"Numbers",4,13,26,"(13:27) And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and vnto al the Congregation of the children of Israel, in the wildernesse of Paran, to Kadesh, and brought to the, and to all the Congregation tydings, and shewed them the fruite of the lande."
"4103",4103,"Numbers",4,13,27,"(13:28) And they tolde him, and saide, We came vnto the land whither thou hast sent vs, and surely it floweth with milke and honie: and here is of the fruite of it."
"4104",4104,"Numbers",4,13,28,"(13:29) Neuerthelesse the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and exceeding great: and moreouer, we sawe the sonnes of Anak there."
"4105",4105,"Numbers",4,13,29,"(13:30) The Amalekites dwell in the South countrey, and the Hittites, and the Iebusites, & the Amorites dwell in the mountaines, & the Canaanites dwell by the sea, & by the coast of Iorden."
"4106",4106,"Numbers",4,13,30,"(13:31) Then Caleb stilled the people before Moses, & saide, Let vs go vp at once, and possesse it: for vndoubtedly we shall ouercome it."
"4107",4107,"Numbers",4,13,31,"(13:32) But the men, that went vp with him, saide, we be not able to goe vp against the people: for they are stronger then we."
"4108",4108,"Numbers",4,13,32,"(13:33) So they brought vp an euill report of the land which they had searched for the children of Israel, saying, The lande which we haue gone through to search it out, is a land that eateth vp the inhabitants thereof: for all the people that we sawe in it, are men of great stature."
"4109",4109,"Numbers",4,13,33,"(13:34) For there we sawe gyants, the sonnes of Anak, which come of the gyants, so that we seemed in our sight like grashoppers: and so wee were in their sight."
"4110",4110,"Numbers",4,14,1,"Then all ye Congregation lifted vp their voice, & cryed: and the people wept that night,"
"4111",4111,"Numbers",4,14,2,"And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron: and the whole assemblie said vnto them, Would God we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wildernesse: would God we were dead."
"4112",4112,"Numbers",4,14,3,"Wherefore nowe hath the Lorde brought vs into this lande to fall vpon the sworde? Our wiues, and our children shall be a pray: were it not better for vs to returne into Egypt?"
"4113",4113,"Numbers",4,14,4,"And they said one to another, Let vs make a Captaine and returne into Egypt."
"4114",4114,"Numbers",4,14,5,"Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assemblie of the Congregation of the children of Israel."
"4115",4115,"Numbers",4,14,6,"And Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh two of them that searched the lande, rent their clothes,"
"4116",4116,"Numbers",4,14,7,"And spake vnto all the assemblie of the childre of Israel, saying, The land which we walked through to search it, is a very good lande."
"4117",4117,"Numbers",4,14,8,"If the Lorde loue vs, he will bring vs into this land, and giue it vs, which is a land that floweth with milke and honie."
"4118",4118,"Numbers",4,14,9,"But rebell not ye against the Lord, neither feare ye the people of the land: for they are but bread for vs: their shielde is departed from the, and the Lorde is with vs, feare them not."
"4119",4119,"Numbers",4,14,10,"And all the multitude saide, Stone them with stones: but the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before all the children of Israel."
"4120",4120,"Numbers",4,14,11,"And the Lord said vnto Moses, How long will this people prouoke me, and howe long will it be, yer they beleeue me, for al the signes which I haue shewed among them?"
"4121",4121,"Numbers",4,14,12,"I will smite them with the pestilence and destroy them, and will make thee a greater nation and mightier then they."
"4122",4122,"Numbers",4,14,13,"But Moses saide vnto the Lorde, When the Egyptians shall heare it, (for thou broughtest this people by thy power from among them)"
"4123",4123,"Numbers",4,14,14,"Then they shall say to the inhabitants of this land, (for they haue heard that thou, Lorde, art among this people, and that thou, Lorde, art seene face to face, and that thy cloude standeth ouer them, and that thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloude, and in a pillar of fire by night)"
"4124",4124,"Numbers",4,14,15,"That thou wilt kill this people as one man: so the heathen which haue heard the fame of thee, shall thus say,"
"4125",4125,"Numbers",4,14,16,"Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the lande, which he sware vnto them, therefore hath he slaine them in the wildernesse."
"4126",4126,"Numbers",4,14,17,"And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lorde be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,"
"4127",4127,"Numbers",4,14,18,"The Lord is slowe to anger, and of great mercie, and forgiuing iniquitie, and sinne, but not making the wicked innocent, and visiting the wickednes of the fathers vpon the children, in the thirde and fourth generation:"
"4128",4128,"Numbers",4,14,19,"Be mercifull, I beseech thee, vnto the iniquitie of this people, according to thy great mercie, and as thou hast forgiuen this people from Egypt, euen vntill nowe."
"4129",4129,"Numbers",4,14,20,"And the Lord said, I haue forgiuen it, according to thy request."
"4130",4130,"Numbers",4,14,21,"Notwithstanding, as I liue, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord."
"4131",4131,"Numbers",4,14,22,"For all those men which haue seene my glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt, and in the wildernes, and haue tempted me this ten times, and haue not obeyed my voyce,"
"4132",4132,"Numbers",4,14,23,"Certainely they shall not see the lande, whereof I sware vnto their fathers: neither shall any that prouoke me, see it."
"4133",4133,"Numbers",4,14,24,"But my seruant Caleb, because he had another spirite, and hath followed me stil, euen him will I bring into the lande, whither he went, and his seede shall inherite it."
"4134",4134,"Numbers",4,14,25,"Nowe the Amalekites and the Canaanites remaine in the valley: wherefore turne backe to morowe, and get you into the wildernesse, by the way of the red Sea."
"4135",4135,"Numbers",4,14,26,"After, the Lorde spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
"4136",4136,"Numbers",4,14,27,"How long shall I suffer this wicked multitude to murmure against me? I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmure against me."
"4137",4137,"Numbers",4,14,28,"Tell them, As I liue (saith the Lorde) I wil surely do vnto you, euen as ye haue spoken in mine eares."
"4138",4138,"Numbers",4,14,29,"Your carkeises shall fall in this wildernes, and all you that were counted through all your nombers, from twentie yeere olde and aboue, which haue murmured against me,"
"4139",4139,"Numbers",4,14,30,"Ye shall not doubtles come into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hande, to make you dwell therein, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun."
"4140",4140,"Numbers",4,14,31,"But your children, (which ye said shoulde be a pray) them will I bring in, and they shall knowe the lande which ye haue refused:"
"4141",4141,"Numbers",4,14,32,"But euen your carkeises shall fall in this wildernes,"
"4142",4142,"Numbers",4,14,33,"And your children shall wander in the wildernesse, fourtie yeeres, and shall beare your whoredomes, vntill your carkeises be wasted in the wildernesse."
"4143",4143,"Numbers",4,14,34,"After the nuber of the dayes, in the which ye searched out the lande, euen fourtie dayes, euery day for a yeere, shall ye beare your iniquity, for fourtie yeeres, & ye shall feele my breach of promise."
"4144",4144,"Numbers",4,14,35,"I the Lord haue said, Certainely I will doe so to all this wicked company, that are gathered together against me: for in this wildernesse they shall be consumed, and there they shall die."
"4145",4145,"Numbers",4,14,36,"And the men which Moses had sent to search the land (which, when they came againe, made all the people to murmure against him, and brought vp a slander vpon the lande)"
"4146",4146,"Numbers",4,14,37,"Euen those men that did bring vp that vile slander vpon the land, shall die by a plague before the Lorde."
"4147",4147,"Numbers",4,14,38,"But Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, of those men that went to search the land, shall liue."
"4148",4148,"Numbers",4,14,39,"Then Moses tolde these sayings vnto all the children of Israel, and the people sorowed greatly."
"4149",4149,"Numbers",4,14,40,"And they rose vp earely in the morning, and gate them vp into the toppe of the mountaine, saying, Loe, we be readie, to goe vp to the place which the Lorde hath promised: for wee haue sinned."
"4150",4150,"Numbers",4,14,41,"But Moses said, Wherefore transgresse yee thus the commandement of the Lorde? it will not so come well to passe."
"4151",4151,"Numbers",4,14,42,"Goe not vp (for the Lorde is not among you) lest ye be ouerthrowe before your enemies."
"4152",4152,"Numbers",4,14,43,"For the Amalekites & the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sworde: for in as much as ye are turned away from the Lord, the Lord also will not be with you."
"4153",4153,"Numbers",4,14,44,"Yet they presumed obstinately to goe vp to the top of the mountaine: but the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde, and Moses departed not out of the campe."
"4154",4154,"Numbers",4,14,45,"Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites, which dwelt in that mountaine, came downe & smote them, & consumed them vnto Hormah."
"4155",4155,"Numbers",4,15,1,"And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4156",4156,"Numbers",4,15,2,"Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, Whe ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I giue vnto you,"
"4157",4157,"Numbers",4,15,3,"And will make an offring by fire vnto the Lorde, a burnt offring or a sacrifice to fulfil a vowe, or a free offring, or in your feastes, to make a sweete sauour vnto the Lord of the hearde, or of the flocke."
"4158",4158,"Numbers",4,15,4,"Then let him that offreth his offring vnto the Lorde, bring a meate offring of a tenth deale of fine flowre, mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of oyle."
"4159",4159,"Numbers",4,15,5,"Also thou shalt prepare ye fourth part of an Hin of wine to be powred on a lambe, appointed for the burnt offring or any offring."
"4160",4160,"Numbers",4,15,6,"And for a ram, thou shalt for a meat offring, prepare two tenth deales of fine floure, mingled with the third part of an Hin of oyle."
"4161",4161,"Numbers",4,15,7,"And for a drinke ofring, thou shalt offer the third part of an Hin of wine, for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord."
"4162",4162,"Numbers",4,15,8,"And when thou preparest a bullocke for a burnt offring, or for a sacrifice to fulfill a vowe or a peace offring to the Lord,"
"4163",4163,"Numbers",4,15,9,"Then let him offer with ye bullocke a meate offring of three tenth deales of fine floure, mingled with halfe an Hin of oyle."
"4164",4164,"Numbers",4,15,10,"And thou shalt bring for a drinke offring halfe an Hin of wine, for an offring made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lord."
"4165",4165,"Numbers",4,15,11,"Thus shall it be done for a bullocke, or for a ram, or for a lambe, or for a kid."
"4166",4166,"Numbers",4,15,12,"According to the nomber that yee prepare to offer, so shall yee doe to euery one according to their nomber."
"4167",4167,"Numbers",4,15,13,"All that are borne of the countrey, shall do these things thus, to offer an offring made by fire of sweete sauour vnto the Lord."
"4168",4168,"Numbers",4,15,14,"And if a stranger soiourne with you, or whosoeuer bee among you in your generations, and will make an offring by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lord, as ye do, so hee shall doe."
"4169",4169,"Numbers",4,15,15,"One ordinace shalbe both for you of the Congregation, & also for the stranger that dwelleth with you, euen an ordinance for euer in your generations: as you are, so shall the stranger bee before the Lord."
"4170",4170,"Numbers",4,15,16,"One Lawe and one maner shall serue both for you and for the stranger that soiourneth with you."
"4171",4171,"Numbers",4,15,17,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4172",4172,"Numbers",4,15,18,"Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come into the lande, to the which I bring you,"
"4173",4173,"Numbers",4,15,19,"And when ye shal eate of the bread of the land, ye shall offer an heaue offring vnto ye Lord."
"4174",4174,"Numbers",4,15,20,"Ye shall offer vp a cake of the first of your dowe for an heaue offring: as the heaue offring of the barne, so ye shall lift it vp."
"4175",4175,"Numbers",4,15,21,"Of the first of your dowe ye shal giue vnto the Lord an heaue offring in your generations."
"4176",4176,"Numbers",4,15,22,"And if ye haue erred, and not obserued all these commandements, which the Lord hath spoken vnto Moses,"
"4177",4177,"Numbers",4,15,23,"Euen all that the Lorde hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the first day that the Lord commanded Moses, and hence forward among your generations:"
"4178",4178,"Numbers",4,15,24,"And if so be that ought be committed ignorantly of the Congregation, then all ye Congregatio shal giue a bullocke for a burnt offring, for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord, with the meat offring and drinke offring thereto, according to the maner, and an hee goate for a sinne offring."
"4179",4179,"Numbers",4,15,25,"And the Priest shall make an atonement for al the Congregation of the children of Israel, and it shalbe forgiuen them: for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offring for an offring made by fire vnto the Lord, and their sinne offering before the Lord for their ignorance."
"4180",4180,"Numbers",4,15,26,"Then it shalbe forgiuen all the Congregation of the children of Israel, & the stranger that dwelleth among them: for all the people were in ignorance."
"4181",4181,"Numbers",4,15,27,"But if any one person sinne through ignorance, then he shall bring a shee goate of a yeere olde for a sinne offring."
"4182",4182,"Numbers",4,15,28,"And the Priest shall make an atonement for the ignorant person, when hee sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make reconciliation for him: and it shalbe forgiuen him."
"4183",4183,"Numbers",4,15,29,"He that is borne among the children of Israel, and the stranger that dwelleth among them, shall haue both one lawe, who so doth sinne by ignorance."
"4184",4184,"Numbers",4,15,30,"But the person that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be borne in the land, or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the Lord: therefore that person shalbe cut off from among his people,"
"4185",4185,"Numbers",4,15,31,"Because he hath despised the worde of the Lord, and hath broken his commandement: that person shalbe vtterly cut off: his iniquitie shalbe vpon him."
"4186",4186,"Numbers",4,15,32,"And while the children of Israel were in the wildernesse, they found a man that gathered stickes vpon the Sabbath day."
"4187",4187,"Numbers",4,15,33,"And they that found him gathering sticks, brought him vnto Moses and to Aaron, and vnto all the Congregation,"
"4188",4188,"Numbers",4,15,34,"And they put him warde: for it was not declared what should be done vnto him."
"4189",4189,"Numbers",4,15,35,"Then the Lord said vnto Moses, This man shall dye the death: & let al the multitude stone him with stones without the hoste."
"4190",4190,"Numbers",4,15,36,"And all the Congregation brought him without the hoste, and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
"4191",4191,"Numbers",4,15,37,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4192",4192,"Numbers",4,15,38,"Speake vnto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes vpon the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and put vpon the fringes of the borders a ryband of blewe silke."
"4193",4193,"Numbers",4,15,39,"And ye shall haue the fringes, that when ye looke vpon them, ye may remember all the commandemets of the Lord, & do them: & that ye seeke not after your own heart, nor after your owne eyes, after the which ye go a whoring;"
"4194",4194,"Numbers",4,15,40,"That yee may remember and doe all my commandements, and bee holy vnto your God."
"4195",4195,"Numbers",4,15,41,"I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to bee your God: I am the Lord your God."
"4196",4196,"Numbers",4,16,1,"Nowe Korah the sonne of Izhar, the sonne of Kohath, the sonne of Leui went apart with Dathan, and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab, & On the sonne of Peleth, the sonnes of Reuben:"
"4197",4197,"Numbers",4,16,2,"And they rose vp against Moses, with certaine of the children of Israel, two hundreth and fiftie captaines of the assemblie, famous in the Congregation, and men of renoume,"
"4198",4198,"Numbers",4,16,3,"Who gathered themselues together against Moses, and against Aaron, and sayde vnto them, Ye take too much vpon you, seeing all the Congregation is holie, euery one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherfore then lift ye your selues aboue the Congregation of the Lorde?"
"4199",4199,"Numbers",4,16,4,"But when Moses heard it, hee fell vpon his face,"
"4200",4200,"Numbers",4,16,5,"And spake to Korah and vnto all his companie, saying, To morow the Lord will shew who is his, and who is holy, and who ought to approche neere vnto him: and whom he hath chosen, hee will cause to come neere to him."
"4201",4201,"Numbers",4,16,6,"This doe therefore, Take you censers, both Korah, and all his companie,"
"4202",4202,"Numbers",4,16,7,"And put fire therein, and put incense in the before the Lord to morowe: and the man whome the Lord doeth chuse, the same shalbe holie: ye take too much vpon you, ye sonnes of Leui."
"4203",4203,"Numbers",4,16,8,"Againe Moses saide vnto Korah, Heare, I pray you, ye sonnes of Leui."
"4204",4204,"Numbers",4,16,9,"Seemeth it a smal thing vnto you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the multitude of Israel, to take you neere to himselfe, to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Lord, & to stand before the Congregation and to minister vnto them?"
"4205",4205,"Numbers",4,16,10,"He hath also taken thee to him, and all thy brethren the sonnes of Leui with thee, and seeke ye the office of the Priest also?"
"4206",4206,"Numbers",4,16,11,"For which cause, thou, and all thy companie are gathered together against the Lord: and what is Aaron, that ye murmure against him?"
"4207",4207,"Numbers",4,16,12,"And Moses sent to call Dathan, & Abiram the sonnes of Eliab: who answered, We will not come vp."
"4208",4208,"Numbers",4,16,13,"Is it a small thing that thou hast brought vs out of a lande that floweth with milke and honie, to kill vs in the wildernesse, except thou make thy selfe lord and ruler ouer vs also?"
"4209",4209,"Numbers",4,16,14,"Also thou hast not brought vs vnto a land that floweth with milke and honie, neither giuen vs inheritance of fieldes and vineyardes: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come vp."
"4210",4210,"Numbers",4,16,15,"Then Moses waxed verie angry, and saide vnto the Lord, Looke not vnto their offring: I haue not taken so much as an asse from them, neither haue I hurt any of them."
"4211",4211,"Numbers",4,16,16,"And Moses said vnto Korah, Bee thou and al thy companie before the Lord: both thou, they, and Aaron to morowe:"
"4212",4212,"Numbers",4,16,17,"And take euery man his censor, and put incense in them, and bring ye euery man his censor before the Lord, two hundreth and fiftie censors: thou also and Aaron, euery one his censor."
"4213",4213,"Numbers",4,16,18,"So they tooke euery man his censor, and put fire in them, and laide incense thereon, and stoode in the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation with Moses and Aaron."
"4214",4214,"Numbers",4,16,19,"And Korah gathered all the multitude against them vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation: then the glorie of the Lorde appeared vnto all the Congregation."
"4215",4215,"Numbers",4,16,20,"And the Lorde spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
"4216",4216,"Numbers",4,16,21,"Separate your selues from among this Cogregation, that I may consume them at once."
"4217",4217,"Numbers",4,16,22,"And they fell vpon their faces and saide, O God the God of the spirits, of all fleshe, hath not one man onely sinned, and wilt thou bee wroth with all the Congregation?"
"4218",4218,"Numbers",4,16,23,"And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4219",4219,"Numbers",4,16,24,"Speake vnto the Congregation & say, Get you away from about the Tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram."
"4220",4220,"Numbers",4,16,25,"Then Moses rose vp, and went vnto Dathan and Abiram, and the Elders of Israel followed him."
"4221",4221,"Numbers",4,16,26,"And he spake vnto the Congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tentes of these wicked men, and touche nothing of theirs, lest ye perish in all their sinnes."
"4222",4222,"Numbers",4,16,27,"So they gate them away from the Tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram on euerie side: and Dathan, and Abiram came out & stood in the doore of their tentes with their wiues, and their sonnes, and their little children."
"4223",4223,"Numbers",4,16,28,"And Moses saide, Hereby yee shall knowe that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works: for I haue not done them of mine owne minde."
"4224",4224,"Numbers",4,16,29,"If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, the Lord hath not sent me."
"4225",4225,"Numbers",4,16,30,"But if the Lord make a newe thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallowe them vp with all that they haue, and they goe downe quicke into ye pit, then ye shal vnderstand that these men haue prouoked the Lord."
"4226",4226,"Numbers",4,16,31,"And assoone as he had made an ende of speaking all these wordes, euen the ground claue asunder that was vnder them,"
"4227",4227,"Numbers",4,16,32,"And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them vp, with their families, and all the men that were with Korah, and all their goods."
"4228",4228,"Numbers",4,16,33,"So they and all that they had, went down aliue into the pit, and the earth couered them: so they perished from among the Congregation."
"4229",4229,"Numbers",4,16,34,"And all Israel that were about them, fled at the crie of them: for they said, Let vs flee, least the earth swalow vs vp."
"4230",4230,"Numbers",4,16,35,"But there came out a fire from the Lorde, and consumed the two hundreth and fiftie men that offred the incense."
"4231",4231,"Numbers",4,16,36,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4232",4232,"Numbers",4,16,37,"Speake vnto Eleazar, the sonne of Aaron the Priest, that he take vp the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire beyond the altar: for they are halowed,"
"4233",4233,"Numbers",4,16,38,"The censers, I say, of these sinners, that destroyed themselues: and let them make of them broade plates for a couering of the Altar: for they offered them before the Lorde, therefore they shalbe holy, and they shall be a signe vnto the children of Israel."
"4234",4234,"Numbers",4,16,39,"Then Eleazar the Priest tooke the brasen censers, which they, that were burnt, had offred, and made broade plates of them for a couering of the Altar."
"4235",4235,"Numbers",4,16,40,"It is a remembrance vnto the children of Israel, that no stranger which is not of the seede of Aaron, come neere to offer incense before the Lord, that he be not like Korah & his copanie, as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses."
"4236",4236,"Numbers",4,16,41,"But on the morowe all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses & against Aaron, saying, Ye haue killed the people of the Lord."
"4237",4237,"Numbers",4,16,42,"And when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, then they turned their faces toward the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and beholde, the cloude couered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared."
"4238",4238,"Numbers",4,16,43,"Then Moses and Aaron were come before the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
"4239",4239,"Numbers",4,16,44,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4240",4240,"Numbers",4,16,45,"Get you vp from among this Congregation: for I wil consume them quickly: then they fell vpon their faces."
"4241",4241,"Numbers",4,16,46,"And Moses said vnto Aaron, Take the censer and put fire therein of the Altar, and put therein incense, and goe quickly vnto the Congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out fro the Lord: the plague is begunne."
"4242",4242,"Numbers",4,16,47,"Then Aaron tooke as Moses commanded him, and ranne into the middes of the Congregation, and beholde, the plague was begun among the people, and hee put in incense, and made an atonement for the people."
"4243",4243,"Numbers",4,16,48,"And when hee stoode betweene the dead, and them that were aliue, the plague was stayed."
"4244",4244,"Numbers",4,16,49,"So they died of this plague fourtene thousande and seuen hundreth, beside them that dyed in the conspiracie of Korah."
"4245",4245,"Numbers",4,16,50,"And Aaro went againe vnto Moses before the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the plague was stayed."
"4246",4246,"Numbers",4,17,1,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4247",4247,"Numbers",4,17,2,"Speake vnto the children of Israel, and take of euery one of them a rod, after the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the familie of their fathers, euen twelue rods: and thou shalt write euery mans name vpon his rod."
"4248",4248,"Numbers",4,17,3,"And write Aarons name vpon the rod of Leui: for euery rodde shalbe for the head of the house of their fathers."
"4249",4249,"Numbers",4,17,4,"And thou shalt put them in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before the Arke of the Testimonie, where I wil declare my selfe to you."
"4250",4250,"Numbers",4,17,5,"And the mans rod, whome I chuse, shall blossome: and I will make cease from mee the grudgings of the children of Israel, which grudge against you."
"4251",4251,"Numbers",4,17,6,"Then Moses spake vnto the children of Israel, and al their princes gaue him a rod, one rod for euery Prince, according to the houses of their fathers, euen twelue rods, and the rod of Aaron was among their roddes."
"4252",4252,"Numbers",4,17,7,"And Moses layde the rods before the Lord in the Tabernacle of the Testimonie."
"4253",4253,"Numbers",4,17,8,"And when Moses on the morow went into the Tabernacle of the Testimonie, beholde, the rod of Aaron for the house of Leui was budded, and brought forth buddes, & brought forth blossoms, and bare ripe almondes."
"4254",4254,"Numbers",4,17,9,"Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lorde vnto all the children of Israel: and they looked vpon them, & tooke euery man his rodde."
"4255",4255,"Numbers",4,17,10,"After, the Lord said vnto Moses, Bring Aarons rod againe before the Testimonie to bee kept for a token to the rebellious children, and thou shalt cause their murmurings to cease from me, that they dye not."
"4256",4256,"Numbers",4,17,11,"So Moses did as the Lord had commanded him: so did he."
"4257",4257,"Numbers",4,17,12,"And the children of Israel spake vnto Moses, saying, Behold, we are dead, we perish, we are all lost:"
"4258",4258,"Numbers",4,17,13,"Whosoeuer commeth neere, or approcheth to the Tabernacle of the Lorde, shal dye: shal we be consumed and dye?"
"4259",4259,"Numbers",4,18,1,"And the Lord sayd vnto Aaron, Thou, and thy sonnes and thy fathers house with thee, shall beare the iniquitie of the Sanctuarie: both thou and thy sonnes with thee shal beare the iniquitie of your Priestes office."
"4260",4260,"Numbers",4,18,2,"And bring also with thee thy brethren of the tribe of Leui of ye familie of thy father, which shalbe ioyned with thee, and minister vnto thee: but thou, and thy sonnes with thee shall minister before the Tabernacle of the Testimonie:"
"4261",4261,"Numbers",4,18,3,"And they shal keepe thy charge, euen the charge of all the Tabernacle: but they shall not come neere the instruments of the Sanctuary, nor to the altar, lest they die, both they and you:"

"4263",4263,"Numbers",4,18,5,"Therefore shall ye keepe the charge of the Sanctuarie, and the charge of the altar: so there shall fall no more wrath vpon the children of Israel."
"4264",4264,"Numbers",4,18,6,"For lo, I haue taken your brethren the Leuites from among the children of Israel, which as a gift of yours, are giuen vnto the Lord, to do the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
"4265",4265,"Numbers",4,18,7,"But thou, and thy sonnes with thee shall keepe your Priestes office for all things of the altar, and within the vaile: therefore shal ye serue: for I haue made your Priestes office an office of seruice: therefore the stranger that cometh neere, shalbe slayne."
"4266",4266,"Numbers",4,18,8,"Againe the Lord spake vnto Aaron, Behold, I haue giuen thee the keeping of mine offrings, of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel: vnto thee I haue giuen them for the anoyntings sake, and to thy sonnes, for a perpetuall ordinance."
"4267",4267,"Numbers",4,18,9,"This shalbe thine of the most holy things, reserued from the fire: all their offering of all their meate offring, and of all their sinne offring, and of all their trespasse offring, which they bring vnto me, that shalbe most holy vnto thee, and to thy sonnes."
"4268",4268,"Numbers",4,18,10,"In the most holy place shalt thou eate it: euery male shal eate of it: it is holy vnto thee."
"4269",4269,"Numbers",4,18,11,"This also shalbe thine: the heaue offering of their gift, with all the shake offerings of the children of Israel: I haue giuen them vnto thee and to thy sonnes and to thy daughters with thee, to be a duetie for euer al the cleane in thine house shal eate of it."
"4270",4270,"Numbers",4,18,12,"All the fat of the oyle, and all the fat of the wine, and of the wheate, which they shal offer vnto the Lord for their first fruites, I haue giuen them vnto thee."

"4274",4274,"Numbers",4,18,16,"And those that are to bee redeemed, shalt thou redeeme from the age of a moneth, according to thy estimation, for the money of fiue shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuarie, which is twentie gerahs."
"4275",4275,"Numbers",4,18,17,"But the first borne of a kowe, or the first borne of a sheepe, or the first borne of a goate shalt thou not redeeme: for they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood at the altar, and thou shalt burne their fat: it is a sacrifice made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord."
"4276",4276,"Numbers",4,18,18,"And the flesh of them shalbe thine, as the shake breast, and as the right shoulder shalbe thine."
"4277",4277,"Numbers",4,18,19,"All the heaue offrings of the holy things which the children of Israel shal offer vnto the Lorde, haue I giuen thee, and thy sonnes, and thy daughters with thee, to be a duetie for euer: it is a perpetual couenant of salt before the Lord, to thee, and to thy seede with thee."
"4278",4278,"Numbers",4,18,20,"And the Lorde sayde vnto Aaron, Thou shalt haue none inheritance in their lande, neyther shalt thou haue any parte among them: I am thy part & thine inheritance among the children of Israel."

"4281",4281,"Numbers",4,18,23,"But the Leuites shal do the seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and they shal beare their sinne: it is a law for euer in your generations, that among the children of Israel they possesse none inheritance."
"4282",4282,"Numbers",4,18,24,"For the tythes of the children of Israel, which they shal offer as an offring vnto the Lord, I haue giuen the Leuites for an inheritance: therfore I haue said vnto them, Among the children of Israel ye shal possesse none inheritance."
"4283",4283,"Numbers",4,18,25,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4284",4284,"Numbers",4,18,26,"Speake also vnto the Leuites and say vnto them, When ye shal take of the children of Israel the tithes, which I haue giuen you of them for your inheritance, then shal ye take an heaue offring of that same for the Lorde, euen the tenth part of the tithe."
"4285",4285,"Numbers",4,18,27,"And your heaue offering shalbe reckened vnto you, as the corne of the barne, or as the abundance of the wine presse."
"4286",4286,"Numbers",4,18,28,"So ye shal also offer an heaue offring vnto the Lorde of all your tithes, which ye shal receiue of the children of Israel, and ye shal giue thereof the Lords heaue offring to Aaron the Priest."
"4287",4287,"Numbers",4,18,29,"Ye shal offer of all your gifts al the Lords heaue offrings: of all the fat of the same shall ye offer the holy things thereof."
"4288",4288,"Numbers",4,18,30,"Therefore thou shalt say vnto them, When ye haue offred the fat thereof, then it shalbe couted vnto the Leuites, as the encrease of the corne floore, or as the encrease of the wine presse."
"4289",4289,"Numbers",4,18,31,"And ye shal eate it in al places, ye, & your housholdes: for it is your wages for your seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
"4290",4290,"Numbers",4,18,32,"And ye shal beare no sinne by the reason of it, when ye haue offred the fatte of it: neither shal ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die."
"4291",4291,"Numbers",4,19,1,"And the Lorde spake to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,"
"4292",4292,"Numbers",4,19,2,"This is the ordinance of the lawe, which the Lorde hath commanded, saying, Speake vnto the children of Israel that they bring thee a red kowe without blemish, wherein is no spot, vpon the which neuer came yoke."
"4293",4293,"Numbers",4,19,3,"And ye shal giue her vnto Eleazar ye Priest, that hee may bring her without the hoste, and cause her to be slaine before his face."
"4294",4294,"Numbers",4,19,4,"Then shall Eleazar the Priest take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle it before the Tabernacle of the Congregation seuen times,"
"4295",4295,"Numbers",4,19,5,"And cause the kow to be burnt in his sight: with her skinne, and her flesh, and her blood, & her doung shal he burne her."
"4296",4296,"Numbers",4,19,6,"Then shal the Priest take cedar wood, and hyssope & skarlet lace, and cast them in the mids of the fire where the kow burneth."
"4297",4297,"Numbers",4,19,7,"Then shal the Priest wash his clothes, and he shal wash his flesh in water, and then come into the hoste, and the Priest shalbe vncleane vnto the euen."
"4298",4298,"Numbers",4,19,8,"Also he that burneth her, shall wash his clothes in water, and wash his flesh in water, and be vncleane vntill euen."
"4299",4299,"Numbers",4,19,9,"And a man, that is cleane, shal take vp the ashes of the kow, & put them without the hoste in a cleane place: and it shalbe kept for the Congregation of the children of Israel for a sprinkling water: it is a sinne offring."
"4300",4300,"Numbers",4,19,10,"Therefore he that gathereth the ashes of the kowe, shal wash his clothes, and remaine vncleane vntil euen: and it shalbe vnto the children of Israel, and vnto the stranger that dwelleth among them, a statute for euer."
"4301",4301,"Numbers",4,19,11,"Hee that toucheth the dead body of any man, shalbe vncleane euen seuen dayes."

"4307",4307,"Numbers",4,19,17,"Therfore for an vncleane person they shall take of the burnt ashes of the sinne offring, and pure water shalbe put thereto in a vessel."
"4308",4308,"Numbers",4,19,18,"And a cleane person shal take hyssope & dip it in the water, and sprinkle it vpon the tent, and vpon all the vessels, and on the persons that were therein, and vpon him that touched ye bone, or the slayne, or the dead, or the graue."
"4309",4309,"Numbers",4,19,19,"And the cleane person shall sprinkle vpon the vncleane the third day, and the seuenth day, and hee shall purifie him selfe the seuenth day, and wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shalbe cleane at euen."
"4310",4310,"Numbers",4,19,20,"But the man that is vncleane and purifieth not himselfe, that person shalbe cut off fro among the Congregation, because hee hath defiled the Sanctuarie of the Lorde: and the sprinkling water hath not bene sprinkled vpon him: therefore shall he be vncleane."
"4311",4311,"Numbers",4,19,21,"And it shalbe a perpetual lawe vnto them, that he that sprinkleth the sprinkling water, shall wash his clothes: also hee that toucheth the sprinkling water, shalbe vncleane vntill euen."
"4312",4312,"Numbers",4,19,22,"And whatsoeuer the vncleane person toucheth, shall be vncleane: and the person that toucheth him, shalbe vncleane vntill the euen."
"4313",4313,"Numbers",4,20,1,"Then the children of Israel came with ye whole Congregation to the desert of Zin in the first moneth, and the people abode at Cadesh: where Miriam died, and was buried there."
"4314",4314,"Numbers",4,20,2,"But there was no water for the Congregation, and they assembled them selues against Moses and against Aaron."
"4315",4315,"Numbers",4,20,3,"And the people chode with Moses, & spake, saying, Would God we had perished, when our brethren died before the Lord."
"4316",4316,"Numbers",4,20,4,"Why haue ye thus brought the Congregation of the Lorde vnto his wildernesse, that both we, and our cattell should die there?"
"4317",4317,"Numbers",4,20,5,"Wherefore nowe haue yee made vs to come vp from Egypt, to bring vs into this miserable place, which is no place of seede, nor figges, nor vines, nor pomegranates? Neither is there any water to drinke."
"4318",4318,"Numbers",4,20,6,"Then Moses and Aaron went from the assemblie vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and fell vpon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared vnto them."
"4319",4319,"Numbers",4,20,7,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4320",4320,"Numbers",4,20,8,"Take the rod, and gather thou & thy brother Aaron the Congregation together, & speake yee vnto the rocke before their eyes, and it shall giue foorth his water, and thou shalt bring them water out of the rocke: so thou shalt giue the Congregation, and their beastes drinke."
"4321",4321,"Numbers",4,20,9,"Then Moses tooke the rod from before the Lord, as he had commanded him."
"4322",4322,"Numbers",4,20,10,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the Congregation together before the rocke, and Moses sayd vnto them, Heare nowe, ye rebels: shall we bring you water out of this rocke?"
"4323",4323,"Numbers",4,20,11,"Then Moses lift vp his hande, and with his rod he smote the rocke twise, and the water came out aboundantly: so the Congregation, and their beastes dranke."
"4324",4324,"Numbers",4,20,12,"Againe the Lorde spake vnto Moses, and to Aaron, Because ye beleeued me not, to sanctifie mee in the presence of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this Congregation into the land which I haue giuen them."
"4325",4325,"Numbers",4,20,13,"This is the water of Meribah, because the children of Israel stroue with the Lorde, and hee was sanctified in them."
"4326",4326,"Numbers",4,20,14,"Then Moses sent messengers from Kadesh vnto the king of Edom, saying, Thus sayth thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the trauaile that we haue had,"
"4327",4327,"Numbers",4,20,15,"How our fathers went downe into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, where the Egyptians handled vs euill and our fathers."
"4328",4328,"Numbers",4,20,16,"But when we cried vnto the Lord, he heard our voyce, and sent an Angel, and hath brought vs out of Egypt, and beholde, wee are in the citie Kadesh, in thine vtmost border."
"4329",4329,"Numbers",4,20,17,"I pray thee that we may passe through thy countrey: we will not goe through the fieldes nor the vineyardes, neither will we drinke of the water of the welles: we will goe by the kings way, and neither turne vnto the right hand nor to the left, vntill we be past thy borders."
"4330",4330,"Numbers",4,20,18,"And Edom answered him, Thou shalt not passe by mee, least I come out against thee with the sword."
"4331",4331,"Numbers",4,20,19,"Then the children of Israel said vnto him, We will goe vp by the hie way: and if I and my cattell drinke of thy water, I will then pay for it: I will onely (without any harme) goe through on my feete."
"4332",4332,"Numbers",4,20,20,"Hee answered againe, Thou shalt not goe through. The Edom came out against him with much people, and with a mightie power."
"4333",4333,"Numbers",4,20,21,"Thus Edom denyed to giue Israel passage through his countrey: wherefore Israel turned away from him."
"4334",4334,"Numbers",4,20,22,"And when the children of Israel with al the Congregation departed from Kadesh, they came vnto the mount Hor."
"4335",4335,"Numbers",4,20,23,"And the Lorde spake vnto Moses and to Aaron in the mount Hor neere the coast of the land of Edom, saying,"
"4336",4336,"Numbers",4,20,24,"Aaron shall be gathered vnto his people: for hee shall not enter into the lande, which I haue giuen vnto the children of Israel, because ye disobeyed my commaundement at the water of Meribah."
"4337",4337,"Numbers",4,20,25,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his sonne, and bring them vp into the mount Hor,"
"4338",4338,"Numbers",4,20,26,"And cause Aaron to put off his garmentes and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: for Aaron shall be gathered to his fathers, and shall die there."
"4339",4339,"Numbers",4,20,27,"And Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went vp into the mount Hor, in the sight of all the Congregation."
"4340",4340,"Numbers",4,20,28,"And Moses put off Aarons clothes, & put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: so Aaron dyed there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came downe from off the mount."
"4341",4341,"Numbers",4,20,29,"When al the Congregation sawe that Aaron was dead, al the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirtie dayes."
"4342",4342,"Numbers",4,21,1,"When King Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt toward the South, heard tel that Israel came by the way of the spies, then fought hee against Israel, and tooke of them prysoners."
"4343",4343,"Numbers",4,21,2,"So Israel vowed a vowe vnto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt deliuer and giue this people into mine hand, then I wil vtterly destroy their cities."
"4344",4344,"Numbers",4,21,3,"And the Lord heard the voyce of Israel, and deliuered them the Canaanites: and they vtterly destroied them and their cities, and called ye name of the place Hormah."
"4345",4345,"Numbers",4,21,4,"After, they departed from the mount Hor by the way of the red Sea, to compasse the land of Edom: and the people were sore grieued because of the way."
"4346",4346,"Numbers",4,21,5,"And the people spake against God and against Moses, saying, Wherefore haue ye brought vs out of Egypt, to die in the wildernesse? for here is neither bread nor water, & our soule lotheth this light bread."
"4347",4347,"Numbers",4,21,6,"Wherefore the Lorde sent fierie serpents among ye people, which stung the people: so that many of the people of Israel died."
"4348",4348,"Numbers",4,21,7,"Therefore the people came to Moses & said, We haue sinned: for wee haue spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray to the Lorde, that he take away the serpents from vs: and Moses prayed for the people."
"4349",4349,"Numbers",4,21,8,"And the Lord said vnto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it vp for a signe, that as many as are bitten, may looke vpon it, and liue."
"4350",4350,"Numbers",4,21,9,"So Moses made a serpent of brasse, and set it vp for a signe: and when a serpent had bitten a man, then he looked to the serpent of brasse, and liued."
"4351",4351,"Numbers",4,21,10,"And ye children of Israel departed thence, and pitched in Oboth."
"4352",4352,"Numbers",4,21,11,"And they departed from Oboth, & pitched in lie-abarim, in the wildernesse, which is before Moab on the Eastside."
"4353",4353,"Numbers",4,21,12,"They remoued thence, and pitched vpon the riuer of Zared."
"4354",4354,"Numbers",4,21,13,"Thence they departed, & pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wildernesse, and commeth out of the coasts of the Amorites: (for Arnon is the border of Moab, betweene the Moabites and the Amorites)"
"4355",4355,"Numbers",4,21,14,"Wherefore it shall be spoken in the booke of the battels of the Lorde, what thing he did in the red sea, and in the riuers of Arnon,"
"4356",4356,"Numbers",4,21,15,"And at the streame of the riuers that goeth downe to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth vpon the border of Moab."
"4357",4357,"Numbers",4,21,16,"And from thence they turned to Beer: the same is the well where the Lord said vnto Moses, Assemble the people, and I wil giue them water."
"4358",4358,"Numbers",4,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song, Rise vp wel, sing ye vnto it."
"4359",4359,"Numbers",4,21,18,"The princes digged this well, the captaines of the people digged it, euen the lawe giuer, with their staues; from the wildernesse they came to Mattanah,"

"4361",4361,"Numbers",4,21,20,"And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the plaine of Moab, to the top of Pisgah that looketh toward Ieshimon."
"4362",4362,"Numbers",4,21,21,"Then Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon, King of the Amorites, saying,"
"4363",4363,"Numbers",4,21,22,"Let me goe through thy land: we wil not turne aside into the fieldes, nor into the vineyardes, neither drinke of the waters of ye welles: we will goe by the kings way, vntill we be past thy countrey."
"4364",4364,"Numbers",4,21,23,"But Sihon gaue Israel no licence to passe through his countrey, but Sihon assembled all his people, and went out against Israel into the wildernesse: and he came to Iahoz, and fought against Israel."
"4365",4365,"Numbers",4,21,24,"But Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and conquered his land, from Arnon vnto Iabok, euen vnto ye children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong."
"4366",4366,"Numbers",4,21,25,"And Israel tooke al these cities, & dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all the villages thereof."
"4367",4367,"Numbers",4,21,26,"For Heshbon was the citie of Sihon the king of the Amorites, which had fought beforetime against the king of the Moabites, & had taken al his land out of his hand, euen vnto Arnon."
"4368",4368,"Numbers",4,21,27,"Wherefore they that speake in prouerbes, say, Come to Heshbon, let the citie of Sihon bee built and repaired:"
"4369",4369,"Numbers",4,21,28,"For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, and a flame from the citie of Sihon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the lords of Bamoth in Arnon."
"4370",4370,"Numbers",4,21,29,"Wo be to thee, Moab: O people of Chemosh, thou art vndone: he hath suffered his sonnes to be pursued, and his daughters to be in captiuitie to Sihon the king of the Amorites."
"4371",4371,"Numbers",4,21,30,"Their empire also is lost from Heshbon vnto Dibon, and wee haue destroyed them vnto Nophah, which reacheth vnto Medeba."
"4372",4372,"Numbers",4,21,31,"Thus Israel dwelt in the lande of the Amorites."
"4373",4373,"Numbers",4,21,32,"And Moses sent to searche out Iaazer, and they tooke the townes belonging thereto, and rooted out the Amorites that were there."
"4374",4374,"Numbers",4,21,33,"And they turned and went vp toward Bashan: and Og the King of Bashan came out against them, hee, and all his people, to fight at Edrei."
"4375",4375,"Numbers",4,21,34,"Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Feare him not: for I haue deliuered him into thine hand and all his people, and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou diddest vnto Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon."
"4376",4376,"Numbers",4,21,35,"They smote him therefore, and his sonnes, and all his people, vntill there was none left him: so they conquered his land."
"4377",4377,"Numbers",4,22,1,"After, the children of Israel departed & pitched in the plaine of Moab on the other side of Iorden from Iericho."
"4378",4378,"Numbers",4,22,2,"Now Balak the sonne of Zippor sawe all that Israel had done to the Amorites."
"4379",4379,"Numbers",4,22,3,"And the Moabites were sore afraide of the people, because they were many, and Moab fretted against the children of Israel."
"4380",4380,"Numbers",4,22,4,"Therfore Moab said vnto the Elders of Midian, Nowe shall this multitude licke vp all that are round about vs, as an oxe licketh vp ye grasse of the fielde: and Balak the sonne of Zippor was King of the Moabites at that time."
"4381",4381,"Numbers",4,22,5,"Hee sent messengers therefore vnto Balaam the sonne of Beor to Pethor (which is by the riuer of the lande of the children of his folke) to call him, saying, Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt, which couer the face of the earth, and lye ouer against me."
"4382",4382,"Numbers",4,22,6,"Come now therefore, I pray thee, and curse me this people (for they are stronger then I) so it may be that I shall be able to smite them, and to driue them out of the land: for I knowe that hee, whome thou blessest, is blessed, and he whom thou cursest, shall be cursed."
"4383",4383,"Numbers",4,22,7,"And the Elders of Moab, and the Elders of Midian departed, hauing the reward of the soothsaying in their hande, and they came vnto Balaam, and tolde him the wordes of Balak."
"4384",4384,"Numbers",4,22,8,"Who answered them, Tary here this night, and I will giue you an answere, as the Lorde shall say vnto mee. So the princes of Moab abode with Balaam."
"4385",4385,"Numbers",4,22,9,"Then God came vnto Balaam, and sayde, What men are these with thee?"
"4386",4386,"Numbers",4,22,10,"And Baalam said vnto God, Balak ye sonne of Zippor, king of Moab hath set vnto me, saying,"
"4387",4387,"Numbers",4,22,11,"Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt and couereth the face of the earth: come nowe, curse them for my sake: so it may be that I shalbe able to ouercome them in battell, and to driue them out."
"4388",4388,"Numbers",4,22,12,"And God said vnto Balaam, Go not thou with them, neither curse the people, for they are blessed."
"4389",4389,"Numbers",4,22,13,"And Balaam rose vp in the morning, and sayde vnto ye princes of Balak, Returne vnto your land: for the Lord hath refused to giue me leaue to go with you."
"4390",4390,"Numbers",4,22,14,"So the princes of Moab rose vp, and went vnto Balak, & sayd, Balaam hath refused to come with vs."
"4391",4391,"Numbers",4,22,15,"Balak yet sent againe moe princes, and more honourable then they."
"4392",4392,"Numbers",4,22,16,"Who came to Balaam, and sayde to him, Thus saith Balak the sonne of Zippor, Bee not thou staied, I pray thee, from coming vnto me."
"4393",4393,"Numbers",4,22,17,"For I wil promote thee vnto great honour, and wil do whatsoeuer thou sayest vnto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people."
"4394",4394,"Numbers",4,22,18,"And Balaam answered, and sayde vnto the seruants of Balak, If Balak woulde giue me his house full of siluer and golde, I can not goe beyonde the worde of the Lorde my God, to doe lesse or more."
"4395",4395,"Numbers",4,22,19,"But nowe, I pray you, tary here this night, that I may wit, what the Lorde will say vnto mee more."
"4396",4396,"Numbers",4,22,20,"And God came vnto Balaam by night, and sayd vnto him, If the men come to call thee, rise vp, and goe with them: but onely what thing I say vnto thee, that shalt thou doe."
"4397",4397,"Numbers",4,22,21,"So Balaam rose vp early, and sadled his asse, and went with the princes of Moab."
"4398",4398,"Numbers",4,22,22,"And ye wrath of God was kindled, because he went: and the Angel of the Lord stood in the way to be against him, as he rode vpon his asse, & his two seruants were with him."
"4399",4399,"Numbers",4,22,23,"And when the asse saw the Angel of the Lord stand in the way, and his sworde drawen in his hand, the asse turned out of the way and went into the field, but Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the way."
"4400",4400,"Numbers",4,22,24,"Againe the Angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyardes, hauing a wall on the one side, and a wall on the other."
"4401",4401,"Numbers",4,22,25,"And when the asse sawe the Angel of the Lord, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, and dasht Balaams foote against the wall: wherefore hee smote her againe."
"4402",4402,"Numbers",4,22,26,"Then the Angel of the Lord went further, & stoode in a narowe place, where was no way to turne, either to the right hand, or to the left."
"4403",4403,"Numbers",4,22,27,"And when the asse sawe the Angell of the Lorde, she lay downe vnder Balaam: therefore Balaam was very wroth, and smote the asse with a staffe."
"4404",4404,"Numbers",4,22,28,"Then the Lorde opened the mouth of the asse, and she saide vnto Balaam, What haue I done vnto thee, that thou hast smitten me nowe three times?"
"4405",4405,"Numbers",4,22,29,"And Balaam saide vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked me: I woulde there were a sworde in mine hand, for nowe would I kill thee."
"4406",4406,"Numbers",4,22,30,"And the asse saide vnto Balaam, Am not I thine asse, which thou hast ridden vpon since thy first time vnto this day? haue I vsed at any time to doe thus vnto thee? Who said, Nay."
"4407",4407,"Numbers",4,22,31,"And the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he sawe the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with his sword drawen in his hande: then he bowed him selfe, and fell flat on his face."
"4408",4408,"Numbers",4,22,32,"And the Angel of the Lord said vnto him, Wherefore hast thou nowe smitten thine asse three times? beholde, I came out to withstande thee, because thy way is not straight before me."
"4409",4409,"Numbers",4,22,33,"But the asse sawe me, and turned fro me now three times: for els, if she had not turned fro me, surely I had euen nowe slaine thee, and saued her aliue."
"4410",4410,"Numbers",4,22,34,"Then Balaam saide vnto the Angel of the Lorde, I haue sinned: for I wist not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore if it displease thee, I will turne home againe."
"4411",4411,"Numbers",4,22,35,"But the Angel said vnto Balaam, Go with the men: but what I say vnto thee, that shalt thou speake. So Balaam went with ye princes of Balak."
"4412",4412,"Numbers",4,22,36,"And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meete him vnto a citie of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, euen in the vtmost coast."
"4413",4413,"Numbers",4,22,37,"Then Balak saide vnto Balaam, Did I not sende for thee to call thee? Wherefore camest thou not vnto me? am I not able in deede to promote thee vnto honour?"
"4414",4414,"Numbers",4,22,38,"And Balaam made answere vnto Balak, Lo, I am come vnto thee, and can I nowe say any thing at all? the worde that God putteth in my mouth, that shal I speake."
"4415",4415,"Numbers",4,22,39,"So Balaam went with Balak, & they came vnto the citie of Huzoth."
"4416",4416,"Numbers",4,22,40,"Then Balak offred bullockes, and sheepe, and sent thereof to Balaam, & to the princes that were with him."
"4417",4417,"Numbers",4,22,41,"And on the morowe Balak tooke Balaam, and brought him vp into the hie places of Baal, that thence hee might see the vtmost part of the people."
"4418",4418,"Numbers",4,23,1,"And Balaam sayd vnto Balak, Builde me here seuen altars, and prepare me here seuen bullockes, and seuen rammes."
"4419",4419,"Numbers",4,23,2,"And Balak did as Balaam sayd, and Balak and Balaam offred on euery altar a bullocke and a ramme."
"4420",4420,"Numbers",4,23,3,"Then Balaam sayde vnto Balak, Stande by the burnt offring, and I will goe, if so be that the Lorde will come and meete me: and whatsoeuer he sheweth me, I will tell thee: so he went forth alone."
"4421",4421,"Numbers",4,23,4,"And God met Balaam, and Balaam sayd vnto him, I haue prepared seuen altars, and haue offred vpon euery altar a bullocke and a ramme."
"4422",4422,"Numbers",4,23,5,"And the Lord put an answere in Balaams mouth, and sayde, Go againe to Balak, and say on this wise."
"4423",4423,"Numbers",4,23,6,"So when he returned vnto him, loe, hee stoode by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab."
"4424",4424,"Numbers",4,23,7,"Then he vttered his parable, and sayde, Balak the king of Moab hath brought mee from Aram out of the mountaines of the East, saying, Come, curse Iaakob for my sake: come, and detest Israel."
"4425",4425,"Numbers",4,23,8,"How shal I curse, where God hath not cursed? or howe shall I detest, where the Lorde hath not detested?"
"4426",4426,"Numbers",4,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I did see him, and from the hils I did beholde him: lo, the people shal dwell by themselues, and shal not be reckened among the nations."
"4427",4427,"Numbers",4,23,10,"Who can tell the dust of Iaakob, and the nomber of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last ende be like his."
"4428",4428,"Numbers",4,23,11,"Then Balak saide vnto Balaam, What hast thou done vnto mee? I tooke thee to curse mine enemies, and beholde, thou hast blessed them altogether."
"4429",4429,"Numbers",4,23,12,"And he answered, and said, Must I not take heede to speake that, which the Lord hath put in my mouth?"
"4430",4430,"Numbers",4,23,13,"And Balak sayde vnto him, Come, I pray thee, with mee vnto another place, whence thou mayest see them, & thou shalt see but the vtmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: therefore curse them out of that place for my sake."
"4431",4431,"Numbers",4,23,14,"And he brought him into Sede-sophim to the top of Pisgah, and built seuen altars, and offred a bullocke, and a ramme on euery altar."
"4432",4432,"Numbers",4,23,15,"After, he sayde vnto Balak, Stande here by thy burnt offring, & I wil meete the Lord yonder."
"4433",4433,"Numbers",4,23,16,"And the Lord mette Balaam, and put an answere in his mouth, and sayd, Goe againe vnto Balak, and say thus."
"4434",4434,"Numbers",4,23,17,"And when he came to him, beholde, hee stoode by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him: so Balak sayde vnto him, What hath the Lord sayd?"
"4435",4435,"Numbers",4,23,18,"And he vttered his parable, and sayde, Rise vp, Balak, and heare: hearken vnto me, thou sonne of Zippor."
"4436",4436,"Numbers",4,23,19,"God is not as man, that he should lie, neither as the sonne of man that he shoulde repent: hath he sayde and shal he not do it? and hath he spoken, and shal he not accomplish it?"
"4437",4437,"Numbers",4,23,20,"Behold, I haue receiued commandement to blesse: for he hath blessed, and I cannot alter it."
"4438",4438,"Numbers",4,23,21,"Hee seeth none iniquitie in Iaakob, nor seeth no transgression in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the ioyfull shoute of a king is among them."
"4439",4439,"Numbers",4,23,22,"God brought them out of Egypt: their strength is as an vnicorne."
"4440",4440,"Numbers",4,23,23,"For there is no sorcerie in Iaakob, nor soothsaying in Israel: according to this time it shalbe sayde of Iaakob and of Israel, What hath God wrought?"
"4441",4441,"Numbers",4,23,24,"Behold, the people shal rise vp as a lyon, & lift vp himselfe as a yong lyon: hee shall not lye downe, till he eate of the pray, and till he drinke the blood of the slayne."
"4442",4442,"Numbers",4,23,25,"Then Balak sayde vnto Balaam, Neither curse, nor blesse them at all."
"4443",4443,"Numbers",4,23,26,"But Balaam answered, & saide vnto Balak, Tolde not I thee, saying, All that the Lorde speaketh, that must I do?"
"4444",4444,"Numbers",4,23,27,"Againe Balak sayd vnto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I wil bring thee vnto another place, if so be it wil please God, that thou mayest thence curse them for my sake."
"4445",4445,"Numbers",4,23,28,"So Balak brought Balaam vnto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Ieshmon."
"4446",4446,"Numbers",4,23,29,"Then Balaam sayde vnto Balak, Make me here seuen altars, and prepare me here seuen bullocks, and seuen rammes."
"4447",4447,"Numbers",4,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had sayd, and offred a bullocke and a ram on euery altar."
"4448",4448,"Numbers",4,24,1,"When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to blesse Israel, then he went not, as certaine times before, to set diuinations, but set his face toward the wildernesse."
"4449",4449,"Numbers",4,24,2,"And Balaam lift vp his eyes, & looked vpon Israel, which dwelt according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came vpon him."
"4450",4450,"Numbers",4,24,3,"And he vttered his parable, and sayd, Balaam the sonne of Beor hath sayde, and the man, whose eyes were shut vp, hath sayd,"
"4451",4451,"Numbers",4,24,4,"He hath sayde, which heard the wordes of God, and sawe the vision of the Almightie, and falling in a traunce had his eyes opened:"
"4452",4452,"Numbers",4,24,5,"How goodly are thy tentes, O Iaakob, & thine habitations, O Israel!"
"4453",4453,"Numbers",4,24,6,"As the valleis, are they stretched forth, as gardes by the riuers side, as the aloe trees, which the Lorde hath planted, as the cedars beside the waters."
"4454",4454,"Numbers",4,24,7,"The water droppeth out of his bucket, & his seede shalbe in many waters, and his king shall be hier then Agag, and his kingdome shall bee exalted."
"4455",4455,"Numbers",4,24,8,"God brought him out of Egypt: his strength shalbe as an vnicorne: he shal eate the nations his enemies, and bruise their bones, & shoote them through with his arrowes."
"4456",4456,"Numbers",4,24,9,"He coucheth and lieth downe as a yong lion, and as a lion: who shall stirre him vp? blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee."
"4457",4457,"Numbers",4,24,10,"Then Balak was very angry with Balaam, and smote his handes together: so Balak sayde vnto Balaam, I sent for thee to curse mine enemies, and beholde, thou hast blessed them nowe three times."
"4458",4458,"Numbers",4,24,11,"Therefore nowe flee vnto thy place: I thought surely to promote thee vnto honour, but loe, the Lorde hath kept thee backe from honour."
"4459",4459,"Numbers",4,24,12,"Then Balaam answered Balak, Tolde I not also thy messengers, which thou sentest vnto me, saying,"
"4460",4460,"Numbers",4,24,13,"If Balak would giue me his house ful of siluer and gold, I can not passe the commandement of the Lorde, to doe either good or bad of mine owne minde? what the Lord shall commaunde, the same will I speake."
"4461",4461,"Numbers",4,24,14,"And nowe behold, I goe vnto my people: come, I will aduertise thee what this people shall doe to thy folke in the later dayes."
"4462",4462,"Numbers",4,24,15,"And he vttered his parable, and sayd, Balaam the sonne of Beor hath sayde, and the man whose eyes were shut vp, hath sayd,"
"4463",4463,"Numbers",4,24,16,"He hath said that heard the words of God, and hath the knowledge of the most High, and sawe the vision of the Almightie, and falling in a traunce had his eyes opened:"
"4464",4464,"Numbers",4,24,17,"I shal see him, but not nowe: I shal behold him, but not neere: there shall come a starre of Iaakob, and a scepter shal rise of Israel, and shall smite the coastes of Moab, and destroy all the sonnes of Sheth."
"4465",4465,"Numbers",4,24,18,"And Edom shalbe possessed, and Seir shall be a possession to their enemies: but Israel shal do valiantly."
"4466",4466,"Numbers",4,24,19,"He also that shall haue dominion shall bee of Iaakob, and shall destroy the remnant of the citie."
"4467",4467,"Numbers",4,24,20,"And when he looked on Amalek, he vttered his parable, and sayd, Amalek was the first of the nations: but his latter ende shal come to destruction."
"4468",4468,"Numbers",4,24,21,"And he looked on the Kenites, and vttered his parable, and sayde, Strong is thy dwelling place, and put thy nest in the rocke."
"4469",4469,"Numbers",4,24,22,"Neuerthelesse, the Kenite shalbe spoyled vntill Asshur cary thee away captiue."
"4470",4470,"Numbers",4,24,23,"Againe he vttered his parable, and sayd, Alas, who shall liue when God doeth this?"
"4471",4471,"Numbers",4,24,24,"The ships also shal come from the coastes of Chittim, and subdue Asshur, and shall subdue Eber, and he also shall come to destruction."
"4472",4472,"Numbers",4,24,25,"Then Balaam rose vp, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way."
"4473",4473,"Numbers",4,25,1,"Nowe whiles Israel abode in Shittim, the people began to commit whoredome with the daughters of Moab:"
"4474",4474,"Numbers",4,25,2,"Which called the people vnto the sacrifice of their gods, and the people ate, & bowed downe to their gods."
"4475",4475,"Numbers",4,25,3,"And Israel coupled himselfe vnto Baal Peor: wherefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel:"
"4476",4476,"Numbers",4,25,4,"And the Lord sayde vnto Moses, Take all the heades of the people, and hang them vp before the Lord against ye sunne, that the indignation of the Lords wrath may be turned fro Israel."
"4477",4477,"Numbers",4,25,5,"Then Moses sayd vnto the Iudges of Israel, Euery one slay his men that were ioyned vnto Baal Peor."
"4478",4478,"Numbers",4,25,6,"And behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought vnto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel, who wept before the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
"4479",4479,"Numbers",4,25,7,"And when Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest sawe it, hee rose vp from the middes of the Congregation, & tooke a speare in his hand,"
"4480",4480,"Numbers",4,25,8,"And followed ye man of Israel into the tent, and thrust them both through: to wit, the man of Israel, and the woman, through her belly: so the plague ceased from the children of Israel."
"4481",4481,"Numbers",4,25,9,"And there died in that plague, foure and twentie thousand."
"4482",4482,"Numbers",4,25,10,"Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4483",4483,"Numbers",4,25,11,"Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar, the sonne of Aaron the Priest, hath turned mine anger away from the children of Israel, while hee was zealous for my sake among them: therefore I haue not consumed the children of Israel in my ielousie."
"4484",4484,"Numbers",4,25,12,"Wherefore say to him, Beholde, I giue vnto him my couenant of peace,"
"4485",4485,"Numbers",4,25,13,"And he shal haue it, and his seede after him, euen the couenant of the priestes office for euer, because he was zealous for his God, & hath made an atonement for the children of Israel."
"4486",4486,"Numbers",4,25,14,"And the name of the Israelite thus slayne, which was killed with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri the sonne of Salu, prince of the familie of the Simeonites."
"4487",4487,"Numbers",4,25,15,"And the name of the Midianitish woman, that was slayne, was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was head ouer the people of his fathers house in Midian."
"4488",4488,"Numbers",4,25,16,"Againe ye Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
"4489",4489,"Numbers",4,25,17,"Vexe the Midianites, and smite them:"
"4490",4490,"Numbers",4,25,18,"For they trouble you with their wiles, wherewith they haue beguiled you as concerning Peor, & as concerning their sister Cozbi ye daughter of a prince of Midian, which was slayne in the day of the plague because of Peor."
"4491",4491,"Numbers",4,26,1,"And so after the plague, the Lord spake vnto Moses, and to Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest, saying,"
"4492",4492,"Numbers",4,26,2,"Take the nomber of all the Congregation of the children of Israel from twentie yeere olde and aboue throughout their fathers houses, all that go forth to warre in Israel."
"4493",4493,"Numbers",4,26,3,"So Moses and Eleazar the Priest spake vnto them in the plaine of Moab, by Iorden towarde Iericho, saying,"
"4494",4494,"Numbers",4,26,4,"From twentie yeere olde and aboue ye shall nomber the people, as the Lord had commanded Moses, and the childre of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt."
"4495",4495,"Numbers",4,26,5,"Reuben the first borne of Israel: the children of Reube were: Hanoch, of whom came the familie of the Hanochites, and of Pallu the familie of the Palluites:"

"4937",4937,"Deuteronomy",5,1,44,"Then the Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine came out against you, and chased you (as bees vse to doe) and destroied you in Seir, euen vnto Hormah."
"4938",4938,"Deuteronomy",5,1,45,"And when ye came againe, ye wept before the Lord, but the Lorde would not heare your voyce, nor incline his eares vnto you."
"4939",4939,"Deuteronomy",5,1,46,"So ye abode in Kadesh a long time, according to the time that ye had remained before."
"4940",4940,"Deuteronomy",5,2,1,"Then we turned, and tooke our iourney into the wildernes, by the way of the red Sea, as the Lorde spake vnto me: and we compassed mount Seir a long time."
"4941",4941,"Deuteronomy",5,2,2,"And the Lord spake vnto me, saying,"
"4942",4942,"Deuteronomy",5,2,3,"Ye haue compassed this mountaine long ynough: turne you Northward."
"4943",4943,"Deuteronomy",5,2,4,"And warne thou the people, saying, Ye shall go through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir, and they shall be afraide of you: take ye good heede therefore."
"4944",4944,"Deuteronomy",5,2,5,"Ye shall not prouoke them: for I wil not giue you of their land so much as a foot breadth, because I haue giuen mount Seir vnto Esau for a possession."
"4945",4945,"Deuteronomy",5,2,6,"Ye shall buy meate of them for money to eate, and ye shall also procure water of them for money to drinke."
"4946",4946,"Deuteronomy",5,2,7,"For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the workes of thine hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wildernes, and the Lorde thy God hath bene with thee this fourtie yeere, and thou hast lacked nothing."
"4947",4947,"Deuteronomy",5,2,8,"And when we were departed from our brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plaine, from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and went by the way of the wildernes of Moab."
"4948",4948,"Deuteronomy",5,2,9,"Then the Lord sayd vnto me, Thou shalt not vexe Moab, neither prouoke them to battel: for I wil not giue thee of their land for a possession, because I haue giuen Ar vnto the children of Lot for a possession."
"4949",4949,"Deuteronomy",5,2,10,"The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great and many, & tall, as the Anakims."
"4950",4950,"Deuteronomy",5,2,11,"They also were taken for gyants as the Anakims: whom the Moabites call Emims."
"4951",4951,"Deuteronomy",5,2,12,"The Horims also dwelt in Seir before time, whome the children of Esau chased out and destroyed them before them, and dwelt in their steade: as Israel shall doe vnto the land of his possession, which the Lord hath giuen them."
"4952",4952,"Deuteronomy",5,2,13,"Now rise vp, sayd I, and get you ouer the riuer Zered: and we went ouer the riuer Zered."
"4953",4953,"Deuteronomy",5,2,14,"The space also wherein we came from Kadesh-barnea, vntill we were come ouer the riuer Zered, was eight and thirtie yeeres, vntill all the generation of the men of warre were wasted out from among the hoste, as the Lord sware vnto them."
"4954",4954,"Deuteronomy",5,2,15,"For in deede the hand of the Lorde was against them, to destroy them from among the hoste, till they were consumed."
"4955",4955,"Deuteronomy",5,2,16,"So when all the men of warre were consumed and dead from among the people:"
"4956",4956,"Deuteronomy",5,2,17,"Then the Lord spake vnto me, saying,"
"4957",4957,"Deuteronomy",5,2,18,"Thou shalt goe through Ar the coast of Moab this day:"
"4958",4958,"Deuteronomy",5,2,19,"And thou shalt come neere ouer against the children of Ammon: but shalt not lay siege vnto them, nor moue warre against them: for I will not giue thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession: for I haue giuen it vnto the children of Lot for a possession."
"4959",4959,"Deuteronomy",5,2,20,"That also was taken for a land of gyants: for gyants dwelt therein afore time, whome the Ammonites called Zamzummims:"
"4960",4960,"Deuteronomy",5,2,21,"A people that was great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims: but the Lord destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them in their inheritance, and dwelt in their stead:"
"4961",4961,"Deuteronomy",5,2,22,"As he did to the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims before them, and they possessed them, and dwelt in their stead vnto this day."
"4962",4962,"Deuteronomy",5,2,23,"And the Auims which dwelt in Hazarim euen vnto Azzah, the Caphtorims which came out of Caphtor destroyed them, and dwelt in their steade."
"4963",4963,"Deuteronomy",5,2,24,"Rise vp therefore, sayd the Lord: take your iourney, and passe ouer the riuer Arnon: beholde, I haue giuen into thy hand Sihon, the Amorite, King of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possesse it and prouoke him to battell."
"4964",4964,"Deuteronomy",5,2,25,"This day wil I begin to send thy feare and thy dread, vpon all people vnder the whole heauen, which shall heare thy fame, and shal tremble and quake before thee."
"4965",4965,"Deuteronomy",5,2,26,"Then I sent messengers out of the wildernes of Kedemoth vnto Sihon King of Heshbon, with wordes of peace, saying,"
"4966",4966,"Deuteronomy",5,2,27,"Let me passe through thy land: I will go by the hie way: I will neither turne vnto the right hand nor to the left."
"4967",4967,"Deuteronomy",5,2,28,"Thou shalt sell me meate for money, for to eate, and shalt giue me water for money for to drinke: onely I will go through on my foote,"
"4968",4968,"Deuteronomy",5,2,29,"(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did vnto me) vntill I be come ouer Iorden, into the land which the Lord our God giueth vs."
"4969",4969,"Deuteronomy",5,2,30,"But Sihon the King of Heshbon would not let vs passe by him: for the Lorde thy God had hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, because hee would deliuer him into thine hand, as appeareth this day."
"4970",4970,"Deuteronomy",5,2,31,"And the Lorde sayd vnto me, Beholde, I haue begun to giue Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possesse and inherite his land."
"4971",4971,"Deuteronomy",5,2,32,"Then came out Sihon to meete vs, him selfe with all his people to fight at Iahaz."
"4972",4972,"Deuteronomy",5,2,33,"But the Lord our God deliuered him into our power, and we smote him, and his sonnes, and all his people."
"4973",4973,"Deuteronomy",5,2,34,"And we tooke all his cities the same time, and destroyed euery citie, men, and women, and children: we let nothing remaine."
"4974",4974,"Deuteronomy",5,2,35,"Onely the cattell we tooke to our selues, and the spoyle of the cities which we tooke,"
"4975",4975,"Deuteronomy",5,2,36,"From Aroer, which is by the banke of the riuer of Arnon, and from the citie that is vpon the riuer, euen vnto Gilead: there was not one citie that escaped vs: for the Lorde our God deliuered vp all before vs."
"4976",4976,"Deuteronomy",5,2,37,"Onely vnto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor vnto any place of the riuer Iabbok, nor vnto the cities in the mountaines, nor vnto whatsoeuer the Lorde our God forbade vs."
"4977",4977,"Deuteronomy",5,3,1,"Then we turned, and went vp by the way of Bashan: and Og King of Bashan came out against vs, he, and all his people to fight at Edrei."
"4978",4978,"Deuteronomy",5,3,2,"And the Lorde sayde vnto me, Feare him not, for I will deliuer him, and all his people, and his land into thine hand, and thou shalt doe vnto him as thou diddest vnto Sihon King of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon."
"4979",4979,"Deuteronomy",5,3,3,"So the Lorde our God deliuered also vnto our hand, Og the King of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him, vntill none was left him aliue,"
"4980",4980,"Deuteronomy",5,3,4,"And we tooke all his cities the same time, neither was there a citie which we tooke not from them, euen three score cities, and all ye countrey of Argob, the kingdome of Og in Bashan."
"4981",4981,"Deuteronomy",5,3,5,"All these cities were fenced with hie walles, gates and barres, beside vnwalled townes a great many."
"4982",4982,"Deuteronomy",5,3,6,"And we ouerthrewe them, as we did vnto Sihon King of Heshbon, destroying euery citie, with men, women, and children."
"4983",4983,"Deuteronomy",5,3,7,"But all the cattell and the spoyle of the cities we tooke for our selues."
"4984",4984,"Deuteronomy",5,3,8,"Thus we tooke at that time out of the hand of two Kings of the Amorites, the land that was on this side Iorden from the riuer of Arnon vnto mount Hermon:"
"4985",4985,"Deuteronomy",5,3,9,"(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Shirion, but the Amorites call it Shenir)"
"4986",4986,"Deuteronomy",5,3,10,"All the cities of the plaine, and all Gilead, and all Bashan vnto Salchah, and Edrei, cities of the kingdome of Og in Bashan."
"4987",4987,"Deuteronomy",5,3,11,"For onely Og King of Bashan remained of the remnant of the gyants, whose bed was a bed of yron: is it not at Rabbath among the children of Ammon? The length thereof is nine cubites, and foure cubites the breadth of it, after the cubite of a man."
"4988",4988,"Deuteronomy",5,3,12,"And this land which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the riuer of Arnon, and halfe mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gaue I vnto the Reubenites and Gadites."
"4989",4989,"Deuteronomy",5,3,13,"And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdome of Og, gaue I vnto the halfe tribe of Manasseh: euen all the countrey of Argob with all Bashan, which is called, The land of gyants."
"4990",4990,"Deuteronomy",5,3,14,"Iair the sonne of Manasseh tooke all the countrey of Argob, vnto the coastes of Geshuri, and of Maachathi: and called them after his owne name, Bashan, Hauoth Iair vnto this day."
"4991",4991,"Deuteronomy",5,3,15,"And I gaue part of Gilead vnto Machir."
"4992",4992,"Deuteronomy",5,3,16,"And vnto the Reubenites and Gadites I gaue the rest of Gilead, and vnto the riuer of Arnon, halfe the riuer and the borders, euen vnto the riuer Iabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon:"
"4993",4993,"Deuteronomy",5,3,17,"The plaine also and Iorden, and the borders from Chinnereth euen vnto the Sea of the plaine, to wit, the salt Sea vnder the springs of Pisgah Eastwarde."
"4994",4994,"Deuteronomy",5,3,18,"And I commanded you the same time, saying, The Lorde your God hath giuen you this lande to possesse it: ye shall goe ouer armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all men of warre."
"4995",4995,"Deuteronomy",5,3,19,"Your wiues onely, and your children, and your cattel (for I know that ye haue much cattel) shall abide in your cities, which I haue giuen you,"
"4996",4996,"Deuteronomy",5,3,20,"Vntill the Lorde haue giuen rest vnto your brethren as vnto you, and that they also possesse the lande, which the Lorde your God hath giuen them beyond Iorden: then shall ye returne euery man vnto his possession, which I haue giuen you."
"4997",4997,"Deuteronomy",5,3,21,"And I charged Ioshua the same time, saying, Thine eyes haue seene all that the Lorde your God hath done vnto these two Kings: so shall the Lorde doe vnto all the kingdomes whither thou goest."
"4998",4998,"Deuteronomy",5,3,22,"Ye shall not feare them: for the Lord your God, he shall fight for you."
"4999",4999,"Deuteronomy",5,3,23,"And I besought the Lorde the same time, saying,"
"5000",5000,"Deuteronomy",5,3,24,"O Lord God, thou hast begunne to shewe thy seruant thy greatnesse and thy mightie hande: for where is there a God in heauen or in earth, that can do like thy workes, and like thy power?"
