government of that colony be commit to the company of virginia, encorporate of a multitude of person, of several disposition, among who the affair of great moment be and must be rule by the great number of uote and voice. and therefore his late majesty, out of his great wisdom and depth of judgement, do desire to. resume that popular government and according the letter patent of that incorporation, be by his highness direction in a legal course question and thereupon judicial repeal and adjudge to be void, wherein his majesty aim be only to reduce that government into such a right course as may best agree with that form, which be hold in the rest of his royal monarchy and be not intend by he to take away or impeach the particular interest of any private plantor or adventurer, nor to alter the same. otherwise, then shall be of necessity for the good of the public, and whereas we continue the like care of those colony and plantation, as our late dear father do, and upon deliberate advice and consideration, be of the same. judgement that our say father be of for the government of that colony of virginia. now, lest the apprehension of former personal difference which have heretofore happen, the revive and continue whereof we utter disallow and strict forbid, may distract the mind of the plantor and adventurer, or the opinion that we will neglect those plantation, may discourage man to go or send thither and so hinder the perfect of that work wherein we hold the honour of our dear father decease and our own honour to be deep engage. we have think fit to declare and by our royal proclamation, to publish our own judgement and resolution in these thing which, by god assistance, we purpose constant to pursue, and therefore we do, by these present, publish. and declare to all our love subject and to the whole world that we hold those territory of virginia and the sommer-iland, as also that of new england, where our colony be already plant and within the limit and bound whereof our late dear father, by his letter, patent under his great seal of england, remain of record, have give leave and liberty to his subject to plant and inhabit, to be a part of our royal empire, descend upon we and undoubted belong and appertain unto we, and that we hold ourself aswell bind by our regal office to protect, maintain and support the same and be so resolve to do as any other part of our dominion, and that our full resolution be to the end. that there may be one uniform course of government in and through all our whole monarchy, that the government of the colony of virginia shall immediate depend upon ourself and not be commit to any company or corporation, to who it may be proper to trust matter of trade and commerce but can be fit or safe to communicate the order of state-affair, be they of never so mean consequence. and that therefore, we have determine that our commissioner for those affair shall proceed according to the tenor of our commission, direct unto they, until we shall declare our further pleasure therein. nevertheless, we do hereby declare that we be resolve, with as much convenient expedition as our affair of great importance will give leave, to establish a council consist of a few person of understanding and quality, to who we will give trust for the immediate care of the affair of that colony and who shall be answerable to we for their proceed and, in matter of great moment, shall be subordinate and attendant unto our privy council here, and that we will also establish another council, to be resident in virginia, who shall be subordinate to our council here for that colony, and that at our own charge we will maintain those public officer and minister and that strength of man, munition and

and adventurer in any of those territory which shall desire the same, to give they full satisfaction for their quiet and assure enjoy thereof. and last, whereas it be agree on all side that the tobacco of those plantation of virginia and the summer island, which be the only present mean for their subsist, can be manage for the good of the plantation, unless it be bring into one hand whereby the foreign tobacco may be careful, keep out, and the tobacco of those plantation may yield a certain and ready price to the owner thereof, we do hereby declare that, to avoid all difference and contrariety of opinion, which will hardly be reconcile among the planter and adventurer themselves, we be resolve to take the same into our own hand and by our servant or agent, for we to give such price to the planter and adventurer, for the same as may give they reasonable satisfaction and encouragement, but of the manner thereof we will determine hereafter at better leisure, and when we shall have conclude the same, we shall expect that all our love subject will ready conform themselves thereunto. and in the mean time, because the importation and use of foreign tobacco which be not of the growth of those plantation or one of they, will, visible and assure, undermine and destroy those plantation by take away the mean of their subsistence, we do hereby strict charge and command that our
