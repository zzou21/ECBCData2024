a consolation for our grammar school the uncomfortable and fruitless toil occasion of this work which the lord have leave unto man to humble they thereby have ever cause many to bend their wit and beat their brain to find out more plain and profitable way both to rel^eve themselves and to make their burden more light among other myself have first have long experience of the manifold evil which grow from the ignorance of a right order of teach and afterward some gracious taste of the sweetness that be to be find in the better course true know and practise I have betake i almost whole for many year unto this weighty work and that not without much comfort through the goodness of our blessed God and thence the more earnest have I pursue this same for that I have be full persuade upon happy experience I trust that I can never employ my thought and travel more acceptable in any earthly thing or whereby a great benefit may redound both to church and commonwealth and in some sort to every soul then in search out and set forth to the view of all the short sure and most easy entrance to all good learning and how with certain hope of good success all may proceed therein who know not the grievous complaint which to the disgrace of learning be make almost in every place the usual complaint against non-proficiency in school for the injury do to country town parent and child because in so many school the child which be the chief hope of parent and posterity be either spoil altogether or else do profit so very little where good be do how hardly it be effect common and for the most part wherein any good be do that it be ordinary effect by the endless vexation of the painful master the extreme labour and ^errour of the poor scholar with endure far overmuch and long severity now whence proceed all this but because so few of those who undertake this function a chief cause hereof want of knowledge of a right course of teach be acquaint with any good method or right order of instruction fit for a grammar school this therefore have be in my heart to show my love and duty to all sort in seek for my part to deliver the poor painful and honest mind schoolmaster from this reproach and grief the author desire to help all this and to help withal to supply this so great a want and in stead hereof my earnest desire have be to procure a perpetual benefit to all estate and degree and to procure a perpetual benefit to all posterity even to every man for his child and posterity by endeavour to make the path to all good learning more even and please in the first entrance then former age have know and thereby also in the continual proceed afterward so far as the lord shall vouchsafe i his merciful assistance in this great attempt that child be so enter in a plain manner may strive towards the goal with undoubted certainty of obtain their desire with pleasant delight and cheerfulness throughout all their time concern the singular benefit and blessing which come by good learning of the rare benefit of learning no good man ever doubt like as to every particular soul and so to whole nation no man true wise do ever yet make doubt no not any one who have know aright what learning mean or who unfeigned love his country the soul of God people or the gospel of Christ for what make a nation to be a glorious nation but that the people be a wise and a understanding people what be it whereby we come so near unto the high or to that bless estate from which by our first parent we be so fall and to which we must be renew and restore if ever we shall inherit again the tree of life as by true understanding and knowledge especial if the same be sanctify unto we yea what be it else whereby we excel the beast but by this divine reason with which the more we be enlighten by the spirit of the lord through the mean of learning the more we differ the more we do excel or who be he that can give God that glory for which he be create and redeem from hell or can in any measure honour he as he ought to do to his own salvation but only he who be endue with right knowledge and understanding contrary whence be that inhumanity as among many of the irish the virginean and all other barbarous nation but from their extreme ignorance of our holy God and of all true and good learning if any man shall dislike of learning the licentiousness of some learned or abuser of learning ought not to cause we to think the worse thereof or think that there be overmuch of it for the strange licentiousness and outrageous course of sundry learned one or for that so many do abuse their learning even to their own perdition without unfeigned repentance why do not the same man dislike also of the light yea of riches honour and pleasure all which be abuse common by the self same man as they have occasion as much as learning be good learning be indeed the heavenly light the true honour the best riches the sweet pleasure learn be all and all in all if we believe that wise Solomon or any of the grave sage who have ever live since the begin of the world neither be the learning of these man the cause of their licentiousness but this be it in truth either that be leave unto themselves to humble they thereby they have put out that light of learning which check and control they and have choose in their course to live in darkness rather than in the light or for that God have therefore in his heavy displeausre and most just judgement as we be to fear of many of they give they up to such palpable blindness in the midst of the shine light of this last age because they love darkness rather than the light job. 3. 19 2. thes. 2. 10. or at least for that they receive not the love of the truth that they may be save but whole to convince all sort learn be the glory of man in the very natural man account that learning be the true light and that principal part of man glory let any natural man ask of his own heart whether if he will have his child bring up to make a worthy man he will not have he train up in the most excellent learning notwithstanding all the abuse of it and whatsoever can be devise against it and why shall any one who know but the law of nature much more the divine law of our holy God that whatsoever we will that man shall do to we even so we shall do to they once grudge or disdain that unto other which of all other thing he most desire for himself and he why shall he not as well repine against they for the use of light see the lord in his rich bounty in like manner grant the light of true learning to be communicate to every one chief for his soul as he shall be capable as well as he have the light of the day for the body and also have charge all most strict to seek after it above all other thing according to that of Solomon wisdom be the principal thing prou. 4. 7. therefore get wisdom and with all thy get get understanding exalt she a^d she shall promote thou she shall bring thou to honour when thou do embrace she wisdom be that one thing without which a man be not in truth a man nor can ever honour his creator as he ought yet to pass over this point as not so needful I hope among we especial the true professor of Christ glorious gospel whereof never any one be a sound favourer who be not likewise a earnest furtherer of the best learning and contrary they only who have seek the ruin of the church as julian have seek cunning at least and under other fair pretence the shut up of the school door and the bring of all good learning into open contempt or base esteem and the rather do I repress myself herein for that this point have be so worthy handle and clear by some of high place now sundry year ago and all obiectour put to silence to ret^rne therefore towards our propose mark the first and principal mean of good learning the school of learning and to consider of the mean whereby the lord bestow this heavenly gift of all true knowledge and good learning be not the first and principal the right education of child in the grammar school which God have ordain to be his nursery of all learning and virtue in very many of which school abroad the contrary rudeness be notwithstanding very much to be pity and lay to heart of all like as it have be long and be at this day too general complain of and that to be fear not without just cause in what school the best learning and nurture be to be find of which sort be all those wherein the scholar be so bring up as that they be make more unfit for any call or so much as to take pain in any profitable employment but these true nursery be only such wherein learned master and usher be encourage with meet maintenance and due reward do follow the best and most approve course a wonderful difference between those school wherein the best order be observe and the rest labour constant to put the same in ure for in these a wonderful difference will appear when they be compare with those other in which the right mean and order be little know and less regard to be put in practice and first to begin with the matter of learning 1. the matter of learning easy in such school which ordinary and in itself through our natural blindness and dulness be so hard and unpleasant it be make in these school most easy and replenish with all sweet delight second for the manner of proceed 2. the manner of proceed in a singular order without confusion it be in these school so direct and orderly to the very high top of all perfection in the same that the thing teach before do ever give light to those that follow after and the late do so hang upon the former as that they have a continual dependence and also the scholar have a continual help and use of all those thing which they have learn before there be moreover in they a very comely array as in a well govern army each know his own rank and office the painful schoolmaster may there expect a rich blessing without the least disorder or confusion whereupon the painful schoolmaster may through God blessing as certain expect much comfortable fruit of his labour as any other man in all the world that even as the best husbandry bring forth usual the great increase the short and safe cut in navigation do fetch in soon the double gain so the short and fair way of teach shall bring in speedy double learning without any loss or danger so as it must needs be great folly to go further about with more trouble and peril where a short and more sure line be plain direct and point out upon infallible experience but for the fruit hereof they will be find such the fruit hereof able to encourage each master to take the uttermost pain to follow the best manner as be able to allure and encourage every one to take the uttermost pain to seek out and to practice the best mean which ever God shall afford for in the mean school will soon appear such a change from raw and rude behaviour unto all commendable quality as if they have be cast in a new mould hence will ensue a marvelous change in school so that very child will begin to understand write speak oppose and answer and in all thing so to demean themselves as to gain the heart of all who shall right make trial and compare they with most other the bring learning into esteem and to make it to be desire and honour of all whence it must needs follow that whereas learning be now common so base repute of and so few in the country abroad regard to set their child to it yet if the best course be in use every one will desire to have his bring up in some learning and nurture the stir up many benefactor to learning and all of the better sort and quality shall be provoke to become benefactor to school to augment their maintenance and encouragement for the nourish and increase of the same thing accompany a right course in proceed these thing likewise will certain accompany such a right order of proceed both a marvelous freedom of the master from their weariness and discontent delivery of the master from much vexation and overmuch severity of scholar from terror and from that overgreat severity which they be enforce to exercise or else to do little good and withal a joyful deliver of the poor child from that continual fear whereby in many school the great part have be wont to be exceed dull and to be make most unwilling to their book that all thing in school may be do with delight and comfort that now contrary master may teach with much delight and comfort and scholar learn with a ingenuous emulation like as they recreate themselves in their ordinary sport and for the time spend in get learning more substantial learning in such at 7. year then in other atten assure more true sound and substantial learning will be find to be get in such place in seven year then be in other common in seven and half seven for this be a thing notorious state of most school and scholar of 15. year of age that in the great part of our common school abroad some few of principal note except the scholar at fifteen or sixteen year of age have not common so much as any sense of the meaning and true use of learning for understanding resolve write or speak but only to construe and to parse a little to steal a exercise and to write such latin as any of judgement will disdain to read unfit for the university that in respect of be fit to be send to the university with credit that they may proceed with delight and understanding when they come there they be common so senseless as that they be much meet to be send home again and if they be admit into the university it be not without the grief of all who respect the credit thereof evil in their entrance and continuance in the university so as that they enter common with foul disgrace and continue with much contempt to spend their friend money and their own precious time which may have be far better employ that they become there a great deal more ready to any kind of exercise then unto the study of good learning the ignorance whereof prove such a reproach unto they hence also after sundry year so evil spend many of they return home again almost as rude as they go thither or be send abroad to be unprofitable burden both of the church and commonwealth perpetual or if such do light into the hand of painful and conscionable tutor tutor must play the schoolmaster if ever they shall do good and fall to their study yet their tutor must then act for they the school-maister part which must needs be very harsh and unpleasing yea rare to be find among they so that in stead of their academical read they must be enforce to supply that which be want in the grammar school such scholar must use extraordinary pain such scholar must likewise use extraordinary pain and industry and be of most happy capacity if ever they shall come to that pitch and height of good learning which be train up right from the beginning they may very easy and in short time have attain unto hereof the complaint of the worthy and most careful tutor in the university give too sufficient testimony and do best shall yet ever feel the want of the grammar school and though such scholar prove never so well yet shall they feel the want of the grammar school all their life long but to leave the university a little and to return to our school again for the grace of they whereas now in sundry of they yea some which be of good maintenance there be to be find some few like unprofitable drone not by the unaptness of nature but for lack of better guidance and education then contrary shall we have all such school general as the little bee-hive if the best order be have the school shall be as the bee-hive every one in his own cell and each know his own task and all gather joint to fill the hive with the most excellent life honey so that taste wheresoever you please you may ever find most sweet contentment if thus the best course be alike make know to all and care have that they may be constant put in practice every where yea than it will come to pass that whereas now there be little or nothing in very many of they wherein the eye or ear can take delight but rather those who come to make trial have enough at the first and ever take just cause of grief that there shall be such lamentable spoil of so many towards youth so reckless misspend of their golden age with such invaluable and irrecoverable loss and injury to all as the goodly garden and sweet sing bird yet in short time we shall see the same as the goodly garden and as among the little sing bird in the flourish spring where we still look and hearken after more sweet variety of pleasant flower and general excel themselves and of melodious tune then shall we find by joyful experience that each mean school will ^ot only excel itself but be equal to many of chief note and as much as the goodly garden do excel the place over grow with brier and nettle the little bee-hive the nest of drone so much shall these each way surpass those same which now they be that we shall as much rejoice in these as ever we grieve for the other that as we have be grieve former for the one we shall be rapt with admiration of the other and think all our pain and cost far too little to be bestow upon they master shall be much more encourage to go on with cheerfulness in see God blessing upon their labour and by hear the due commendation give to their scholar then by any other reward whatsoever the child shall ever likewise have their emulation increase master and scholar shall proceed with all alacrity which of they all shall most excel and to conclude this point hence it shall come to pass that although all can not be expect to excel in learning though all shall not excel yet all shall be fit to some good employment for the benefit of the whole for then shall we be leave destitute of husbandman to till the ground and much more of meet supply to furnish all other calling neither be it possible by all the mean or pain in the world to make such to be scholar to who God in their natural constitution seem to have deny it chief where parent or teacher themselves be too indulgent or remiss so that their child be disobedient much absent from school come and go at their pleasure neglect their exercise or the like or have be spoil by ill entrance at the first yet these thing will follow through a right and careful government that a good part will be find in every form to credit the school some to store the university other to adorn all other place and condition of life that thereby may be have man expert in each kind as necessity shall require for the common benefit and good of all all these ve^ied in some few school all these thing we may see verify in some few and rare school by compare of which with most other and so by consider what a difference there be only through the better course practise constant in they we may full judge of the truth of all that have be say and most necessary be enforce to subscribe thereto upon the due consideration hereof this endeavour to discharge a debt to all by make all sort partaker of the blessing which he have vouchsafe and upon much and loug experience of diverse place together with the certain assurance of these and the like undoubted benefit which must needs ensue general upon the best course of learning and good education first diligent seek out among all and then divulge for the public good to be put in practice I have presume to endeavour to my poor ability as the lord have vouchsafe i mercy to make all sort partaker of this blessing and thus to be pay my debt to all in communicate the same unto they this travel therefore have be duty to all in high place for their child and posterity and be my duty and service first unto you all you worthy of the chief rank who be

of their country and not to live to the overthrow or the dishonour of your house and name much less to the evil example or to the spoil of the poor people among who they dwell as those who leave their name for a curse behind they it have be and be my debt desire to all parent and true desire to all parent to further their comfort in their belove child that they may see before their eye their child forwardness in learning and virtue which may be unto they some recompense of all their love care and cost and also that be hereby encourage to bring they up virtuous they may always have the testimony of a good conscience to cause they to rejoice in that they have have this first care to provide they this portion hereby they may depart hence with gladness when they may leave those in their place in who they may see just hope that they shall live still in the earth with worthy reputation and in more especial manner have it be my study for all such who in their natural and tender affection to all more tender heart parent will have their child bring up in the most love and gentle manner as it be in play and with ingenuous strife and emulation without that sharpness which they can endure so much as once to hear of yea to all likewise of the mean sort wel-wishing to the poor sort that even their child may the more easy attain unto learning that so some of they be advance thereby may become a stay to their parent a comfort to their kinsfolk a credit to their country which bring they up and to come unto our school to the school themselves for who comfort I have chief spend my strength it be my love unto you all that you may be such fertile seminary of the best instruction and nurture as to replenish all place and calling such as from which all cruelty and terror may be drive far away

to the diligent study of the famous and ancient grecian or roman history and their noble war to help the better to preserve and defend your native country or for the succour of the distress part of God true church and the poor member of Christ against that roman Antichrist as you now see the lord to need your help and call you forth thereto that thus you may receive comfort to your own soul of the pardon of your former course and of the lord favour when you shall walk with he in some profitable call which otherwise I can never see how you can attain unto but that you shall find the flash of h^ll within you when your conscience shall be once thorough awaken to consider serious how unprofitable you have be and of that fearful doom denounce against the unprofitable servant cast that unprofitable servant into utter darkness matth. 25. where shall be weep and gnash of tooth this will sure be execute upon you without your unfeigned repentance and lay lively hold on the lord jesus Christ final it have be desi^e to all function and be my unfeigned desire to all function and place and more particular to every rude place as to the ignorant country of Wales and more especial that poor irish nation to all rude place as to Wales to the irish Virgi^ia the Sommerlland^ with our love countryman of Virginia or where ever else if it may please the lord to cause the light to break forth upon they which now fit in such palpable darkness and in the shadow of death and whole under the slavery of Satan to the end to make the way of knowledge more easy unto they not only to the attain of the latin tongue but also that hereby they may much more easy learn our english tongue to help to reduce the barbarous to more civility and so to plant god true religion there that jesus Christ may reign among they Satan kingdom fall and they save eternal if the lord vouchsafe they that mercy to this purpose I can but oft think of the speech of a worthy learned man who Cambridge in his time much reverence master John ireton of Legworth in Leicestershire who have labour many year with little fruit among a blind and superstitious people be wont much to lament that he be enforce to labour in a barren soil where salt have be sow whence he use to affirm that the chief hope of God church for all such pleace so nuzzle up in rudeness and superstition be to come out of our grammar school and indeed for bring man unto civility the very heathen see this to be the only way according to these verse of the poet which be familiar to every child add art ovid. right learning of ingenuous art the savage frame to civil part this be one chief cause that all the wise among they do so much prefer and ever so advance learning and learned man to shut up this point discharge of debt to all this I trust shall bring a blessing in due time to every one when this way of attain to learning shall become so plain and direct as that each poor man child may with a little cost and labour get some understanding to know how to serve the high God and his own necessary occasion and that the child and posterity of those may come to the knowledge of the truth who themselves have live in most gross ignorance and extreme blindness by the mean hereof every one shall be the better enable to pay that debt that every one may pay the debt of his birth which by his very birth he owe unto the lord and to his native country for we be none of we bear unto ourselves for that none of we be bear to ourselves but as the heathen orator can say our country do challenge a part of our life and service our parent a part our friend a part etc. so that all the course of the life of every one of we shall be bend to the faithful discharge of this our debt so to leave to posterity a thankful remembrance of our well deserve of they if the heathen profess this how much more shall we christian oft bethink ourselves how much we owe not only to our country and to the church of God in general but even to every particular soul and more special to those who he have link we to by near bond and to this end ought each of we to seek as he offer opportunity to be always pay this debt of we which none be likely to discharge so well as they who have be best instruct in their youth hereupon there shall never be want many cheerful advancer of all good learning learning be in reputation shall never want multitude of benefactor from which so many blessing do proceed especial when learning shall come into the right estimation this also shall be the chief glory of all such in the earth to have be benefactor and furtherer unto the best learning and true piety and likewise a notable evidence of the eternal happiness prepare for they to this purpose if that heathen orator can likewise say further the chief glory in earth to be advancer o^ learning and piety even by the light of nature that to all who have preserve help or any way augment the happiness of their country there be a most certain place ordain in the heaven where they shall enjoy eternal happiness how much more bold may we christian avouch the same upon certain ground out of the word of God that there be indeed a place of everlasting happiness and glory prepare for all those who in witness of their love and thankfulness to jesus Christ and to their country shall employ their study and their wealth to the great advancement of all heavenly learning and unto the virtuous education of youth the hope of the succeed age final the glory of our nation shall be increase as learning increase from all these shall the glory of our nation be enlarge continual when man of true wisdom and godliness do both rule and obey every where a state most certain to endure long a prince ten time happy and renown to be the head of a people so excel in all true wisdom and understanding be thus undoubted persuade of so many and rich blessing to ensue a part of our happiness to show our love in further so great a good upon the right find out and make know the best course of teach in the grammar school without the least evil that I can surmise I have think that this shall be a special part of my comfort and a mercy above all other outward favour which the lord have ever vouchsafe i if I may but do the least service herein or but show my desire to further so great a good hereupon have I be encourage as I say not only to travel thus far in it but also to tender this my poor service unto all presume upon the kind acceptance of it among all sort which the lord have hitherto vouchsafe so far forth as I know because my confidence have be from my first entrance into this travail according to the desire of my heart that these small beginning may soon receive such plentiful augmentation as in time to accomplish all the good which have be mention and as the lord have verify among very many will I trust every day more manifest unto all why this work be the more hasten to the public view I also at the first edition of it hasten it the more because as we be bear for all as before be say and receive all our talent for the benefit of every one to who they may do good and be thereby each so deep indebt unto they so I have endeavour since to increase my former experiment and to make they undoubted by full and most certain trial as I trust and hearty pray that all sort for who they have be write the uncertainty of our life ought to make we to do all the good we can while we may may reap some benefit by they so long as school or learning shall remain and what be my life but a vapour so that I may have be take away before the work^ have ever come to light like as some of my fellow labourer in this kind have be of who I receive some of these direction m. to^ey m. Coote m. Richardson and those not of the small moment who have be able to have do far great service in this kind we can appear before our ^od if we have not do our uttermost endeavour to pay our debt and to employ our talent to bring most advantage to our master most of who worthy experiment in this behalf be bury with they or how can I have ever stand before the lord if be so full resolve and assure of the good that may come by this labour and for that likewise by the bond of the communion of saint all to who this benefit of it may redound have interest in it the lord also have offer i so fit opportunity I shall not have seek the discharge of this my debt to the uttermost farthing may I not just have fear that he will have be displease for my negligence and loiter in so necessary a work why shall I not then still communicate from time to time what he have further vouchsafe i in my continual travel yea why shall I not stir up all my love brother to the full perfect of that which have be by his goodness bring thus far forward towards the same why shall we suffer the industry of the enemy to be a condemnation to we consider well the industry of our enemy for omit our opportunity of accomplish any service which may concern the glory of our god the welfare of this people and the perpetual benefit of this our dear nation when they watch all occasion not only to hinder whatsoever good they can among we but to put out for ever the candle of Israel witness for ever the powder furnace when as they will toil day and night with the peril of their life to undermine and blow up our royal king and prince our noble and worthy with all our glory at once thereby to make a easy passage to their most bloody and accurse massacre to murder all who bear any love to Christ gospel yea to destroy utter all the people of the lord even through the whole world if it be possible as their furious rage do at this day proclaim though with the endless destruction of themselves both soul and body and even of their native country their mother which breed they notwithstanding this work have not be set upon rash but undertake by a holy and warrantable call I have not rash attempt to enter into this so great a work but I hope that I may true say that the lord our love god who have holpen i hitherto have call i unto it and this have he do partly enforce i by necessity to seek out the easy speedy and best mean to manage this my call and whereby I may do most good in my place to be thereby in some sort answerable to the same partly by give i a confident assurance even from the begin of this my travel what a benefit may come to all sort by the ready course once find out and more also in this that I have seem to myself by his goodness to have from time to time gain ever somewhat by my search and have withal observe how much some few school have excel other chief through the better course which they have follow partly by vouchsafe i strength and cheerfulness to proceed thus far still add unto i some new experiment more special by cause i to have a earnest desire and a hope by this mean to answer the love of certain worthy friend in seek that good to they which I be not able to perform unto themselves but above all have he call i hereunto by the encouragement which I have receive from some principal benefactor to school by special benefactor to school such who have authority to command ^y service and good learning who though they may by their authority and favour have command all my service yet know my endeavour herein have both most love cheer i and withal somewhat support i to go through with this so weighty a business the ^ight hon. e of h. m. johnson archdeacon of Leicestershire for the good of their own school and place and of all other who have not think it enough to find or bestow the place and to endow they with meet maintenance unless they shall also do what may be to leave in they the best mean of all good instruction and education to who not only myself but the church of God as I trust shall ever be behold from his sovereign majesty desire for all his schol=ols but to pass over this point that worthy desire of our royal sovereign who the lord long preserve to his glory and the good of all his people namely to have all good learning to flourish in these his dominion declare so many way and special in that his gracious incitement to all schoolmaster in the conclusion of his majesty letter set before our common grammar aught not only to provoke but to bind we all who have this function and charge to endeavour ourselves to the uttermost to search out still the best mean for the most fruitful train up of our scholar in all good literature and virtuous condition where he so royal assure we that as we shall receive reward of almighty God for the same so of his majesty worthy commendation and therefore whatsoe^er comfort we shall find by our travel therein to make the same full know for the general good of all as God shall vouchsafe we fit occasion thereunto for the manner which I have use in all this proceed for the manner of proceed in this work the preface to our common grammar do direct it the preface to the reader in the same our common grammar have direct i where have affirm that the variety of teach be diverse and always will be for that every schoolmaster like that which he know and see not the use of that which he know not and therefore judge that to be the most sufficient way which he see to be the ready means to bring a learner to have knowledge therein it direct we thus wherefore it be not amiss say it if one see by trial a easy and a ready way than the common sort of teacher do will say that he have prove and for the commodity allow it that other not knnw the same may by experience prove the like and then by proof reasonable judge thereof not hereby exclude the better way when it be find but in the mean season forbid the worse this course have I follow in all direction which I have here observe and set they down according whereas it may be object and say though many have write hereof yet none have proceed in this particular manner for the help of he mean that sundry have write very learned treatise concern the train up of youth I answer that it be so indeed yet that I may speak in modesty as the truth be all the learned do well know that they be such as do only set down the same in a general manner or do write of some one piece or two alone or at most of some few part of grammar learning and matter appertain thereunto and the principal of they unknown to the common sort of teacher or else they be beyond the capacity and reach of the mean sort for who this be chief intend or at least they have special fit their course for the instruction of two or three alone to be train up in private house as our renown master A^kam but none who I know or have hear of have in this kind of search and trial go through the several part of our grammarschoole learning apply themselves for the weak and for the common country school thus lead they as by the hand through all the whole course thereof only according to our common grammar and most approve classical author neither have I in this this work have not be proceed in by private conceit follow my own private conceit but beside search by read trial and observation I have first for many year inquire further as I say the best course from the most experience who have prove they even of such as have send most excellent scholar unto the university as I have be assure from some of the chief in the same second I have make trial to see a demonstration of every thing three I have have so much as I can the judgement of all the learned with who I can confer or communicate four so far as I have be able I have procure yearly trial to be make by some of the best authority learning and judgement that I can obtain this favour of and have entreat they to censure all thing frank and to direct we wherein they find or think we defective to confirm and encourage we wherein we proceed in a right course neither have I confer with any love friend hereof so far as I remember who have not approve of the course and wish all good success to this my travel nor post on but hasten slow so that I have not post it forward but haste slow and use so far as God have grant i opportuniy all mean of due preparation and of mature deliberation thus inquire of as I say and confer with so many of the best experience as either my call or greatness of the charge in travel will permit and moreover before I publish any thing hereof in print I send some draught unto sundry learned for their help and direction though not to the hundred man to who I desire for that I be neither able to get copy enough write nor to procure they write true much less to be at the charge to send they abroad into all part to many who I know will willing have lay to their hand and add their experiment therefore herein also in steed of send any more write copy abroad I after a time by the counsel of some faithful and judicious well-willer to this work think it best to follow that worthy precedent of most happy labour master Perkins who when he be in hand with his problem be advise to send some copy first to his learned friend answer that he can not get copy enough write and though he procure some write forth and by good scholar yet they be so defective as that he can not well send they and for that cause he will print some few of they first which may go forth to the view of the world and so he may hear the common censure of all and receive the help of his friend and then reform according thus do I adventure to send forth the former draught of my grammar school with some other part belong to the same to the public view of all that I may the soon hear and receive the free censure and better direction of all love friend and well-willer unto this work so to be forthwith try reform and supply like as I have continue until this day in the whole work the author assume to himself only the want and error as I promise not any thing but my travel which I have strive to perform with all the poor ability which the lord have vouchsafe i so I take nothing to myself but only the want and error the rest be he who have give this desire and prolong my life grant i understanding strength and opportunity to bring it thus far forward what direction or experience herein I have receive from other as yet or late live I will have set down with their name adjoin like as I have do of some which I know may have bring much credit to the work for the authority of sundry of they and thereby every one of they have have their due but that they do not think it meet desire to be conceal what I have gather out of the write of the chief learned who have reviue learning in this last age as Melanchton Erasmus and other either short set down or plain point at in they I have omit likewise to mention particular not any way to wrong or detract from they but partly for that I do not note the place at my read of they and moreover for that I think that labour more troublesome than profitable to the reader neither take I upon i any way to prescribe to the mean prescribe not to any know myself so far inferior to the great part but do begin to think more and more of this weighty call as Paul do of the sacred ministry and to break out into that his admiration who be sufficient for these thing who be meet to have the treasure both of church and commonwealth with the hope of all posterity commit unto he and much more to prescribe perpetual rule in this behalf much less do I presume to teach they of most excellent gift but as a poor fellow labourer for the common good and a willing learner of all I do humble desire the judgement and help of all the chief learned both for their cause who wish this and for the universal benefit of the present age and of all posterity that I may see still both what they approve in the course set down also what they disallow and likewise upon what ground what may be better what be yet want and what be superfluous thus be my heart desire to travel in it still according as I have begin until the lord shall accomplish the whole work which although it shall be seven year more yea many more before yet the lord prolong my day I shall ever increase in rejoice in my undoubted assurance of the rich blessing which God will give unto it and think all my labour most happy spend but herein let not any man expect from i great matter in a lofty kind of verse or prose or eminency in declamation oration or the like this I leave to our worthy renown school of Westminster Eton Winchester and the rest both in London and elsewhere and to our schoolmaster of chief fame who breed and employment in school have be according and who have ancient scholar long exercise in these kind concern who I be so far off from envy any excellent learning in they that I wish all other partaker of the like in their kind and for myself I content i with this mercy from the lord and bless he for it that I have travel chief for our mean and rude school and that he have vouchsafe i this favour to bring my work so far forward as to help to direct hitherto according to the thing mention in the content yet this I humble desire of all such of principal note for education gift and experience to further we with their better direction in all these exercise and the rest and now God have so accomplish my desire for the first foundation and let i see his blessing upon the little on we I will labour to follow they in what I be too short as fast as his goodness shall enable until I shall likewise find by experience wherein that excellency and comfort of they do consist and come as near unto they as I can though therein for the length of the work in the grammar school reason for the length of the work I have in many thing contract very much in this edition and for those thing wherein I may seem over tedious as namely in the first entrance of child in teach accidence and grammar also for construe parse and make latin I will have all consider how therein I have contend to direct the careful master to incite both himself and his little one as by play to make the least to love the school and learning and for that those thing be well perform all the difficulty be past yea in all such place I will wish you ever still to remember this that I write not for the great learned but chief for the simple and young beginner both teacher and learner with who I can be too plain although I have and do still strive to abridge whatsoever can be so as I may be well conceive of all for who I labour and in the end of every chapter have usual repeat brief the sum thereof and know withal that I have think it my duty to set down whatsoever I have find to be profitable that out of they all the best may be settle be confirm by the trial of many in which respect some of great learning who peruse the work former have not see how it can well be any short nor what may well be spare especial be thus offer to the public censure consider moreover what great volume have be write of some one of these point alone whereas my endeavour have be to go through they all show in every one what I take to be principal necessary or behoveful and final remember that which marshal witty and true affirm martial epig. thing be not long wherein there be not aught to spare those for who it have be labour in who will not vouchsafe it the read because of the length will much less have take the pain or have be at the cost to have travel search and try to have find it out although this I dare constant avow and keep within my bound that it have countervail unto i both the labour of a hundred time read it over and as many time the charge if I have know but the thing from my first entrance into teach which God have now thus make know to all beside the free both of my body and mind from much toil and grief notwithstanding that I then both read all who I can get in this argument of teach and also have from the begin for sundry year the advice and direction of * * master John ireton of kegworth mention before one in who house I live who be well know to be inferior to few in all excellent learning and even in this kind among other neither do I doubt but that whosoever he be that will do good in this function especial of the new beginner and shall peruse the work with desire to make his benefit of it shall meet with some one thing alone or other in it which if he will practice it aright he will free acknowledge to be worth all his labour as I have do sundry of they at the receive and trial of they and much more shall he do the same for all the rest yet for those who will not read over the whole treatise at large the use of it to the learned who will not read the whole they may see the sum brief in the margin and so in the table in the end to read what they desire to pass over the rest but for they for who I have travel I have much rather to be overlong to the end that I may omit nothing which concern their help better for the learner that the work shall be overlarge then too short and may be understand of all then by be over-short to omit many thing or not to be understand of the great part as it fall out in most compendium for as I once hear a great learned and holy man say public in the university concern compendium D^ (@) that they bring ordinary but a compendiarie knowledge so it will be find certain true among all learner of they in matter of any difficulty unless they have the help of good reader or of most familiar commentary and exposition to make they plain because common the learner do imagine that they have get that learning by they which indeed they be ignorant of and so cease from search further although for those who understand they full or have mean to have they plain open they be of most singular use for the easy remember and practice of the thing contain in they moreover howsoever I shall not be able to attain to each point aim at here and wish nor to any one of they in the absolute perfection this travel happy employ if but to effect these thing follow yet I ever think from the beginning that my travel shall be most happy employ if I may effect but only these thing follow or some of they as namely if I may but set other on work 1. if but to set other on work hereby to search yet further or to make trial of these experiment or better for the full assurance of all sort to find out at length that which be desire or second 2. or to gain more experiment which man be so hardly draw to communicate if it be but to gain the experiment of some other who have most happy travel herein and the rather for that sundry of chief experience in this kind be so hardly draw to impart that which they know either for lack of opportunity or lest they shall be think to presume over much or suspect the censure of other or for some like by respect whereby both church and commonwealth be deprive of their due to wit of such singular help as may exceed tend to the benefit of they both or three 3. or to make know sundry most profitable book and help if I may but make know among alsort sundry most profitable book and help which God have to this end provide both for master and scholar which have former be hide and be utter unknown to the great part or four 4. to help all desirous to do good and yet toil without fruit if I may but only help such of my brother as toil without fruit or comfort weary themselves in a earnest study to do good and do mourn and sigh wish better direction and much more those who never know any good proceed and live as burden to the public hurt for lack of direction in this behalf that so not any one who make conscience of his call and will inquire shall be unprofitable yea fifthly if but to gain one year if I may but help the common sort how to gain but one year only in the get of learning though there may be hope of almost double sound learning to that which have be in many rude place and lessen of charge chief for the poor albeit that my undoubted hope be that by these course alone almost double sound and good learning may be gain in regard of that which have be and be in many country school for understanding speediness certainty and delight that little child be right train up may do more at nine or ten year old then in many place at fourteen or fifteen as master Askam say concern the northern part in his time when they go to the school little child and come away great lubber always learning little profit learn without book every thing and understand within book little or nothing as he right affirm and for the further evidence hereof that so much more good may be do hereby it be very apparent in this that a great deal may be gain by three or four of these help alone for that so much may be gain by three or four of these help alone which either be not know or not practise in the ordinary school as first by win a year or two in the beginning by ^etting they to school so soon as they be able to learn second by cause all thing in school to be do with understanding of the benefit whereof see chap. 5. of the grammar school three by make the scholar very perfect first in their ground viz accidence chief in noun and verb after the manner which be show there and after likewise in the grammar itself for the perfect use understanding and apply of the rule this will gain much in time and more in ease and certainty than can be imagine four by make they very perfect in their author as they proceed five by the knowledge and practice of the rule of construe and of translation form according unto the same for all the low sort six by have in all thing the most easy sure and excellent pattern to follow which they be keep unto constant must needs come in time to express very lively or at least come near unto they to omit the benefit of increase in our own tongue as in the latin and all thing for go certain without stagger or doubt and much more by their grow in their writing together with their other learning and that by one and the same labour now if by these few so much may be gain and much more by all the rest together be constant practise then let every man judge what we may certain expect if many more learned well-willer will add still but each his several experiment these same among other have be the several end whereat I have aim and think my labour shall be happy employ if I may in any sort attain unto they wherein how far the lord have vouchsafe to fulfil my desire I refer it to every one who have or shall due make trial of that which I have write that I do in this work so much account of grammatical translation reason of the high account of grammatical translation which I so oft mention in the grammar school as namely chap. 8. where I show the manner use and benefit of they I hope that this will be find true by experience that after child have be well train up in their accidence and a little enter and acquaint with they follow the course direct for they they will go over their whole author so translate by the help of they before they can have go through one three part of they without and also that they will learn their author far more perfect for each good use and keep they much more sure with less labour or trouble beside that they shall continual learn by they to make latin true and pure and to get matter and phrase aswell as to construe and parse and furthermore because in all the form which shall use they chief in the high they will be find for the most part to be in stead of the master or usher labour and ever certain teach english as well as latin without any of the inconvenience usual imagine so that there be a wise direction and oversight as in all other thing that they be use aright beside experience the reason be most evident as I have show in their place chap. 8. especial by make all their author to be so easy and soon understand and then for the continual practice by they of the grammar analysis and genesis and final that by they may be such a daily use of translate both into english and latin all which be so high commend by the learned for the speedy get of any tongue and hereunto the two first leaf of master askam schoolmaster who I principal esteem and propound master askam testimony of the practice of translate do give sufficient testimony he in the very entrance of his book sharp reprove the common order of make latin practise in school and have show how by that as it be common say child be utter mar and also have give most manifest reason of the hurt which come thereof for the fear that child be drive into affirm moreover that nothing have more dull the wit or take away the will of child from learning then that and last how they learn evil choice of word wrong place and ill frame of sentence and that which they must unlearn again he afterward speak thus concern this kind of translate and the benefit of it there be a way say he touch in the first book of Cicero this be well worthy the mark of all which wise bring into school true teach and constant use will not only take away that butcherly fear of make latin but also with ease and pleasure and in short time as I know by good experience work a true choice and place of word a right order of sentence a easy understanding of the tongue or readiness to speak facility to write a true judgement both of his own and other man do what tongue soever he do use then he set down the manner how the child shall be teach to translate a piece of Tully or a like author thus plain and afterward out of his translation to turn it into the latin of the author again and then by compare with the author to see how near he come and where he miss so to amend it still strive until he come to express his author true by this he say the master may teach all those thing which be most tedious and difficult without any error and the scholar may learn without any great pain the master be lead by so sure a guide and the scholar bring into so plain and easy a way this be the sum of master askam speech now these grammatical translation of our low school author do perform the same thing for all young scholar far more sure and speedy more sure because the scholar translate into english of himself unless the master use marvelous diligence before in make he very perfect in the true construe of it and as much after in peruse and amend every thing which be faulty the child will miss in translate and if he translate false into english or miss of the grammatical order he can not translate into the same latin again upon sure ground and reason unless he go by rote as we say moreover that labour for so peruse the translation of every one of each form through a school will be endless in the great school and much more when they have turn it into latin for compare all with the author and reduce each thing into the right order whereas these be so translate unto their hand do first guide they certain how to construe or to translate to read all thing which they learn by they into a true translation and consequent to turn they perfect into the latin of the author again these do it also more speedy more speedy in as much as they may read over many line turn they into english or latin before that they can write one although that kind of translate by pen of themselves both into english and latin have also her due place and singular use for some special benefit thereof as write true orthography and the like as I shall show in the handle of it furthermore this very course in effect practise by master Askam this very course of translate piece of Tully or the like good author into plain natural english by the master himself and give they to the scholar to turn into latin to try how near he can come to the author and then compare it with the author he set down in the begin of his second book page 2. by this mean he see that experience which may seem almost incredible experience of the singular benefit of it in master John Whitne^ in that hopeful young gentleman who death he so much bewail master John whitney in sir Anthony Dennies house where the lady Elizabeth do lie when he come to serve she that within less than the space of a year he have so profit in write pure latin that as he say some in seven year in the grammar school yea some in the university can not do half so well so afterward he see the like in his happy scholar that ever England have breed our late queen who make we all happy who as he say do so far surpass all of her year in excellency of learning this way of translate the chief and sure mean to attain speedy to any tongue master askam schoolmaster lib. 2. p. 33. and knowledge of diverse tongue that very few of the rare wit in the university can any way reach unto she and this seem evident to have be the chief mean like as he prove at large by the authority of many great learned this way of translate to be either the only or at least the chief ready and sure mean to attain speedy to any tongue and that I may add but one other testimony of a rare and know experience in this kind a late know and worthy experience in a young nobleman of rare hope at the commencement of that right noble and memorable gentleman sir John Harington who now rest and reign with the lord have speech with master tovey who have be a schoolmaster equal as he be judge to most of the chief in that kind but be then whole employ for the attendance and tuition of that young nobleman with who he also live now in heaven I desire to know this of he that whereas I have write unto he former to have take some pain in set down the short and best way of teach according to his experience and now there be a rare fame that God have give a extraordinary blessing to his endeavour with that young nobleman so that he do of a sudden go far beyond most other of his time above all former expectation that he will vouchsafe to impart unto i in a word or two what be the principal mean he have use thereto he acknowledge thankful that he have indeed see much experience of God mercy therein tell i that this be the principal and sum of his course that he have be enforce to begin again even from the very accidence cause he to get the perfect understanding of the rule for the meaning and use though he can not the word in so short a time and after that he have cause he to practice continual translate into latin after this manner that he himself have choose easy place of Tully and other familiar author which the gentleman know not and cause he to turn they into latin and after bring he to the author to compare that which he have write to the same just according to this last manner mention out of master Askam after round i in the ear he say but shall I tell you it be by prayer quoth he hereupon after my return I set myself to put all these in practice yet more serious then former I have do but for this kind of translate find the toil and impossibility of it first to translate piece fit for every form and after to examine every one exercise how he have translate and to correct they I whole bend myself to try how this may be do through the several low form that they may have most practice of it thus try sundry way which be overlong to recite and among other have see in a chief school in London good use of verbal translation among some other thing I begin to think that by the mean of translation of the first author which scholar learn this translate may be practise in each low form continual but there be yet two main difficulty which have former hinder i from any such use of they first that our usual translation do direct the young scholar uncertain and sometime amiss be oft rather to express the sense than the word in any right order of grammar and that the learner must go by memory and as it be by rote more than by any certainty of rule unless they be of better judgement and second that for this and other inconvenience translation be general in disgrace in school therefore this than I think necessary to be my first labour to find out some certain rule to follow according to which to frame these translation and which may be the guide of all and herein I to who the find out of the rule and of translation thereby be acknowledge under jesus Christ acknowledge myself be hold for the rule of construe and translate in the begin of my school labour now above 30. year ago first to master Crusius since to the reverend and ancient schoolmaster master leech three after they to that painful master Coote of hunsden in Essex now with the Lord and four to that learned Go^levius and to some other of my acquaintance who have likewise take pain in this rule which they willing impart unto i and so from that time until this day labour to find out the rule and to frame the translation according I have still be labour to find out the rule more exact and to frame the translation according to the same second this have be my next study to seek out the right use and benefit of these translation and also the right use and benefit of they and so in all thing to set they down as they may be a certain direction whereby most easy and sure to reap the fruit of they last I have travel herein special to have full trial and assurance in every thing and final to have ^ull assurance of every thing that as I have gather these among other experiment for the use of all school so upon certain proof by myself and other of better judgement I may at length commend they to all learner and so help to bring in that excellent use of they which master Askam advise even into the school in which they have be so former distaste as that it be think a paradox but to name the use of translation i^ they now upon this rule upon what thing all the chief benefit of these translation depend and the express every thing in the translation both in propriety and also according to the sense and meaning of the author with variety of other english phrase and supply what be want to make up the construction with the other thing observe therein especial upon the rule depend all the chief benefit for a certain analysis and genesis both for construe parse make and tie Latin sure and sundry of the rest chap. 8. as be show at large in the eight chapter of the grammar school by the right practice of these translation so frame as I be full assure certain benefit of these translation right use by long experience through the lord mercy and goodness a increase will be find in learning far more than can be well conceive before due trial make and that with much less trouble to the master then otherwise and with far more delight certainty ease and cheerful emulation to the scholar I have therefore think it my duty after my unfallible experience of they right use so as I have plain set down the manner in this second edition of my grammar school and after my so long and painful travel to find out the rule most certain with the best and most profitable use thereof to commend they more confident unto all our school and to all desirous to recover speedy the knowledge of their latin tongue or to increase therein in a certain affiance that all who shall use they aright shall see a rich blessing without inconvenience yet lest in any thing I shall be think too peremptory I entreat the learned first to make proof then to judge hereof according as they find for any further apology therefore for my bold attempt further apology needless except 1. the author desire to do all this good in these endeavour I trust that some few of the reason light touch before may be defence sufficient and first my unfeigned study to do all this good to all sort without the least injury to any one so far forth as I shall know it or without invert any approve course and that howsoever I have be the unfit of many of my brother to enter upon so hard a task yet the weak the more meet have I be to have a compassionate feel of the want of other and more like to apply myself to the capacity of the mean and most ignorant whereas the great learned and acute do oft time think that what they themselves understand all other shall present conceive though the most of the simple comprehend little or nothing of it full as they shall second 2. the have all these experiment gather to our hand for that in these my poor labour every one may have the weary travel and comfortable experiment of many learned thus gather into one and bring thereby unto his hand without labour or charge which otherwise may have cost they many mile travel and some year trial as well as myself and yet they may have fail of many thing which here they may find and more hereafter as God shall vouchsafe more supply unto it three 3. assurance of each man affection to have his child so bring up as be here desire because there be no man have the nature of a wise father who will not have his child to have some learning howsoever he purpose to employ he afterward and who to that end will not have he so instruct as whereby to get the best learning in the short time and with the least severity or who will not give almost double if he may be assure to have his child so train up four 4. for the testimony of his conscience to be upright and faithful (@) all his work for that I have he who search and try the heart and who good hand have be with i in goodness in all this work to bear witness unto my conscience that I have not either in this or any other my travel aim at vain praise or commendation for that our holy god will turn into shame or at any other sinister end but that I have strive with all my heart so far as in my weakness I have be able to aim at those very end alone which our bless saviour have teach i in that divine pattern of heavenly prayer which have be in all my labour my principal direction and namely to manifest my duty and thankfulness to my heavenly father like as for all other his mercy chief in heavenly thing in Christ and for innumerable temporal favour in his fatherly providence protection and direction vouchsafe unto i 1. 1588. so more especial for those three great deliverance to be have in everlasting remembrance not only of our church and nation 2. the death of queen Elizabeth and peaceable bring in our sovereign and of all other the church of Christ with they but even of myself particular in every one of they and this I have desire to do by seek first to honour he 3. powder ^reason and second to advance and enlarge his kingdom and to these end search to know and accomplish all his holy will tend thereunto and so all the other subordinate end as he have direct i thus have I endeavour to rely upon that his gracious promise that thus seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all these other thing shall be add unto i as a over-measure so far as shall be good and herein indeed I have feel no breach of promise from his majesty but find he faithful and true yea exceed bountiful above all that I can conceive in all thing wherein his goodness have enable i so to seek he upon all these ground I can nothing doubt but through the mercy of the lord this labour be intend to these very end and prove to be answerable thereunto without inconvenience in the right use of it as my assure confidence be I can but full hope that it will in due time be most welcome and acceptable to all that ever shall make trial by themselves or other last 5. for willing submission of al^ thing to the public cen^ure for that I willing submit it with all my labour to the love censure of all the learned who true love Christ gospel be ready to be teach of the mean who shall in any thing show i my error or give i clear light and though the defect shall still be very many as in so difficult a work it be no great marvel yet sith I be most desirous to be continual reform every ingenuous well-willer unto good learning will I trust love pardon they and thankful accept of that which God of his goodness have grant thus I put forth each first copy of translation or other and desire to be still learning of all as not set forth but to go more general to all my love friend and wellwishers to this work to crave of they further help as I say before to this end I do still humble request every true favourer of good learning to lay to his hand that so I may be continual learning amend and perfect so long as the lord shall lengthen my day if in any thing the cause of the confi^nt rejoice in it I have or shall seem to rejoice overmuch yet consider first that in my general work in my grammarschoole I have think the form of a dialogue most fit wherein more liberty be grant to incite and encourage other second that I have not nor will speak any more then either what I have see experience of or whereof upon good ground I be full assure and which I take myself bind to relate only to the praise of our god and the good of other to make all other partaker of the comfort which to that end he have vouchsafe unto i follow so near as I can that direction mention before in the preface before our common grammar three remember that report of master Askam concern master John whitney far great than all mine be together and then I doubt not these thing be right weigh but all who be wise heart will easy bear with i in my confident rejoice trust moreover that God will verify all thing to every one who shall due make trial and in this affiance and testimony of my conscience before his sacred majesty I whole rely myself therefore exhortation and encouragement to the weak teacher before I conclude give i leave a little to turn my speech to you my dear fellow labourer and namely to all you of the weak sort for who I have and do still chief travel who heart be set as i to do all the good you can in your several place all your day to you all I wish that as we have be sometime companion in fruitless toil and vexation so we may be now in rejoice at and admire the new fruit of our labour what a grief may this just be unto we grief to all honest heart master for complaint and murmur against they when one shall come and cry out of we to our face my son have be under you six or seven year and yet be not able so much as to read english well much less to construe or understand a piece of latin or to write true latin or to speak in latin in any tolerable sort complaint of parent for the^^ child not profit which he may have be well able to have perform if that you have take that course and those good pain with he which you may have do for in such a school other much young than i be able to do it another shall complain my son come on never a whit in his writing beside that his hand be such murmur of town for charge ill bestow and child spoil that it can hardly be read he also write so false english that he be neither fit for trade nor any employment wherein to use his pen when all in a town general shall murmur against we in this or the like manner that their child do no good under we but lose their time and spend their friend money be bring up idle make fit for nothing and therefore what shall a school do among they that it be much better to turn the maintenance give to the school to bear the charge of the town for other duty and service than so unprofitable to employ it moreover how must this need trouble we some to cry out against our severity when many shall cry out of our severity some shall wish I will my child have never know he if he have not deal so cruel with my child he have be a scholar whereas now he be undo or when our scholar come to man estate shall curse we for that by our blow they be make dunce or deaf though this oftentimes unjust or to hate all learning scholar come to man estate to bewail loss of their time or shall general bewail the loss of their time under we complain as the usual manner be my master never teach i any understanding or right use of good learning that though I be with sundry yet I be never the better I get more sense and see more light for the use and excellency of learning and also feel more sweetness therein in one half year in the end with one who direct i in a better order then in all my time with all other the rest deceive my parent and be my undo or when they shall thus complain our master have not any care of our government and manner that they be not teach any religion he never teach we the fear of the lord nor make the least conscience to plant any religion or grace in we final terror for for lack of growth of God religion what a terror shall this be unto we and what a wound to our conscience when we shall but think how the lord and all good man may most just lay this unto our charge that the cause have be chief in we that God religion have not thrive any better in our land in so long a time but that popery ignorance atheism and all irreligiousness have far more grow up in many place if we have be as careful to season our youth in the truth of Christ and to settle they in the ground of his holy religion true profess among we to their salvation as the popish schoolmaster be to corrupt they with idolatry and superstition unto perdition the knowledge and love of God true worship and piety have flourish among we every where long ago all popery and atheism root out and what answer can we think to make to God for his religion and people for so many who have be lose chief through our lack of care how shall these thing touch every one of we even to the very heart and cause we to bethink ourselves at length of this our weighty function to the end to take away all this reproach and to begin to recover the credit of our worthy profession you know well the charge commit to we that we be they to who charge that rich treasure both of church and common wealth be commit in trust as be say and the
